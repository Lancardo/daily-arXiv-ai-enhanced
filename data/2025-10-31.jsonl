However, existing techniques such as X-ray\ndiffraction and electron microscopy require specialized facilities or\ndestructive preparation and cannot provide full three-dimensional (3D)\ninformation. Here we introduce incoherent dielectric tensor tomography (iDTT),\na non-interferometric optical imaging method that quantitatively reconstructs\nthe 3D dielectric tensor under incoherent, polarization-diverse illumination.\nBy combining polarization diversity and angular-spectrum modulation, iDTT\nachieves speckle-free and vibration-robust mapping of biaxial birefringence\nwith submicron resolution. Simulations and experiments on uniaxial and biaxial\nsamples validate its quantitative accuracy. Applied to mixed and\npolycrystalline materials, iDTT distinguishes crystal types by their\nbirefringent properties and reveals 3D grain orientations and boundaries.

The HCF produced 27 fs pulses from 230 fs inputs\nat >50% efficiency, whereas the MPC achieved 34 fs pulses with significantly\nhigher efficiency (>88%). Both results aligned well with numerical simulations.\nCrucially, spatial wavefront analysis revealed that the HCF acts as a modal\nfilter, improving beam quality, whereas the MPC introduces aberrations through\ncumulative mirror errors. Furthermore, we characterize the photon flux of high\nharmonic generation driven by the post-compressed pulses from the HCF and MPC.\nThese finding highlights that post-compression technique based on self-phase\nmodulation is efficient for the intensity boosting of femtosecond laser system,\nproviding opportunities for generating high quality extreme ultraviolet (XUV)\nsources.

However, their atomic thinness renders\nthem susceptible to damage during nanoscale fabrication. Focused ion beam\ntechnology, while offering precise defect engineering for tailoring\noptoelectronic properties, often induces collateral damage far beyond the\ntarget region, compromising device performance. This study addresses the\ncritical challenge of preserving the intrinsic optical characteristics of 2D\nTMDCs during FIB patterning. We demonstrate that conventional dielectric\nencapsulation fails to protect 2D TMDCs from gallium ion-induced damage,\nleading to persistent defects and quenched optical responses in patterned\nmicrostructures. In contrast, polymeric encapsulation with PMMA (polymethyl\nmethacrylate) effectively mitigates damage by acting as a sacrificial layer\nthat absorbs ion impact, thereby preserving the optical properties of the\nunderlying TMDC. Furthermore, we leverage XeF2-assisted Ga ion beam direct\npatterning, which significantly reduces collateral damage, minimizes Ga ion\nimplantation, and enables precise anisotropic material removal, yielding\nultra-smooth sidewalls critical for high-quality photonic resonators. This\ncombined approach of PMMA encapsulation and XeF2-assisted FIB patterning offers\na robust, cost-effective, and scalable single-step fabrication route for\nintegrating 2D TMDCs into high-performance photonic devices, thereby\nmaintaining their intrinsic optical functionality essential for advancing\nquantum technologies and compact optical circuits."}

In this work, we systematically assess the\nperformance of pDFXM relative to monochromatic DFXM when using a compound\nrefractive lens (CRL) as the objective. Analytical expressions for the spatial\nand angular resolution are derived and compared with numerical simulations\nbased on geometrical optics and experimental data. The pink-beam configuration\nprovides an increased diffraction intensity depending on the deformation state\nof the sample, accompanied by a general tenfold degradation in angular\nresolution along the rocking and longitudinal directions. This trade-off is\ndisadvantageous for axial strain mapping, but can be advantageous in cases\nwhere integrated intensities are needed. For a perfect crystal under parallel\nillumination with a pink beam, our results show that chromatic aberration is\nabsent, whereas under condensed illumination it becomes significant. The\naberration is shown to depend strongly on the local distortion of the crystal.\nWeak-beam imaging conditions, such as those required for resolving\ndislocations, are shown to remain feasible under pink-beam operation and may\neven provide an improved signal-to-noise ratio. The higher incident flux,\nenhanced by nearly two orders of magnitude, is quantified in terms of beam\nheating effects, and implications for optimized scanning protocols are\ndiscussed."}
