Abstract: Non-Hermiticity naturally arises in many physical systems that exchange
energy with their environment. The presence of non-Hermiticity leads to many
novel topological physics phenomena and device applications. In the
non-Hermitian energy band theory, the foundation of these physics and
applications, both energies and wavevectors can take complex values. The energy
bands thus become a Riemann surface, and such an energy-band Riemann surface
underlies all the important signatures of non-Hermitian topological physics
phenomena. Despite a long history and recent theoretical interests, the
energy-band Riemann surface has not been experimentally studied. Here we
provide a photonic observation of the energy-band Riemann surface of a
non-Hermitian system. This is achieved by applying a tunable imaginary gauge
transformation on the platform of the photonic synthetic frequency dimension.
From the measured topology of the Riemann surface, we reveal the complex-energy
winding, the open-boundary-condition spectrum, the generalized Brillouin zone,
and the branch points. Our findings demonstrate a unified framework in the
studies of diverse effects in non-Hermitian topological physics through an
experimental observation of energy-band Riemann surfaces.

Abstract: Photonic time crystals (PTCs) - dielectric media whose permittivity is
periodically modulated in time - map to a Dirac equation with an imaginary
mass, opening a momentum gap (k-gap) where modes grow or decay exponentially.
Here, we introduce a sequence of temporal Jackiw-Rebbi kinks that act as a
programmable flip of the Dirac mass, exchanging the amplifying and decaying
in-gap modes. By launching two seeded pulses with a controlled relative phase,
we demonstrate topological pair annihilation in spacetime domain, the
phase-selective cancellation of counter-propagating, k-gap-amplified modes. The
resulting spatiotemporal cascade appears superluminal, yet causality is
preserved because the cascaded pattern carries no net energy flux. To
facilitate implementation, we construct a minimal time-varying non-Hermitian
lattice model and reproduce the phase-selective pair annihilation behavior,
establishing a direct continuum-lattice correspondence. Our results identify
topological kinks as temporal gating to manipulate the growth and wave
propagation of time-varying media.

Abstract: A long optical path length is critical in achieving sensitive spectroscopy.
For cavity ringdown spectroscopy, a cavity consisting of two supermirrors
provides a long path length, where high reflectance of the supermirrors results
from their slight excess loss. In the case of a crystal coating supermirror,
the excess loss has been suggested to depend on polarization. On the other
hand, an amorphous coating supermirror was expected to have a negligible
polarization dependence. In this work, we measured the excess loss as a
function of mirror rotation around its optical axis in the optical region at
681.2 nm for the three amorphous coating supermirrors produced simultaneously
by vapor deposition in the same furnace. The back mirror of the cavity was
rotated, and the ringdown time as a function of rotational angle was measured
every 10 degrees. As a result, sinusoidal variations in excess loss were
observed depending on the rotation. The difference in excess loss between the
best and worst rotational angles during the rotation of the back mirror reached
a maximum of 5.8 +- 1.2 ppm. This difference demonstrates the importance of
optimizing the rotational angle alignment of supermirrors to achieve high
sensitivity via a long path length in cavity ringdown spectroscopy.

Abstract: Disorder-driven, integrated speckle spectrometers offer exceptional spectral
resolution within a compact design. They benefit from enhanced optical path
lengths due to multiple light scattering events, however, often at the cost of
low optical throughput. Here, we investigate the relationship between these two
figures of merit by systematically varying the scattering strength of
random-uniform disorder distributions. Furthermore, we also investigate the
temperature stability of such spectrometers. Our study shows that the device
resolution can be tuned from 2 nm to 20 pm, while the operating temperature
ranges from 1 to more than 6 degrees and throughput can be varied by more than
a factor of 10, paving the way for application-tailored design of microscale
high-resolution spectrometers.

Abstract: Geometric phases provide a powerful mechanism for light manipulation. In
particular, the Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) phase has enabled optical metasurfaces
with broad applications. However, the PB phase is based on polarization
evolution in a two-dimensional space, which fails to account for other
polarization degrees of freedom. Here, we generalize the concept of geometric
phase to a four-dimensional (4D) Riemann-Silberstein (RS) space that
characterizes the complete electromagnetic polarization, including electric,
magnetic, and hybrid polarizations. We show that the 4D polarization evolution
in the RS space can give rise to a new geometric phase-the RS phase-in addition
to the PB phase. The PB phase depends on optical spin and usually manifests in
circularly polarized light, whereas the RS phase depends on optical linear
momentum and can manifest in arbitrarily polarized light. Their synergy
provides a unified geometric framework for light propagation at interfaces and
enables unprecedented high-dimensional light control. As a proof of principle,
we propose and demonstrate RS metasurfaces capable of multiplexed wavefront
shaping, which can reconfigure up to twelve distinct outputs via switching
incident 4D polarization. Our work uncovers a new class of optical geometric
phases, with promising applications in high-capacity optical communication,
parallel information processing, and multifunctional nanophotonic design.

Abstract: Dielectric metasurfaces can achieve strong light-matter interaction based on
several types of collective (nonlocal) resonances, such as surface lattice
resonances (SLRs) and quasi bound states in the continuum (quasi-BICs).
Spectral selectivity, field enhancement, and high and controllable Q-factors
make these resonances appealing for technological applications in lasing,
sensing, nonlinear optics, and quantum photon sources. An emerging challenge
focuses on tailoring light-matter interaction via mode coupling and
hybridization between the fundamental resonances of a metasurface. While strong
coupling phenomena have been demonstrated between various resonant modes, the
interplay between collective resonances of different natures has not been
observed to date. Here, we theoretically, numerically, and experimentally
demonstrate the onset of coupling and hybridization between symmetry-protected
quasi-BICs and SLRs in a dielectric metasurface. We show (1) the emergence of
anticrossing (or Rabi splitting) in the strong coupling regime with suppression
of reflection, observed under TE-polarized excitation, and (2) the
manifestation of an accidental BIC under TM-polarized illumination as a result
of energy exchange between the participating collective resonances in the weak
coupling regime. Both effects are accompanied by hybridized near-fields of the
modes. The observed coupling mechanisms can be controlled by modifying the
angle of incidence, polarization, and surrounding environment. This
foundational study on the coupling and hybridization of collective resonances
offers insights that can be leveraged for the design of metasurfaces with
targeted quasi-aBIC and collective hybridized resonances. It could also open
new possibilities to control the near fields associated with such resonances,
with promising applications in tunable nanophotonics and light manipulation.

TL;DR: 本文通过结合3D眼球模型和视网膜视杆细胞密度数据，利用光线追踪模拟确定了用于极弱光视觉实验的最佳眼球对准条件：刺激应以13.1度的下视角呈现，且水平和垂直角度精度需优于0.85度。

Conclusion: 该研究为极弱光视觉实验提供了具体的眼球对准指导，确定了最佳呈现角度和对准精度要求，有助于提高此类实验的可重复性和准确性。

Abstract: In experiments probing human vision at the few-photon level, precise
alignment of the eye is necessary such that stimuli reach the highest-density
rod region of the retina. However, in literature there seems to be no consensus
on the optimal eye alignment for such experiments. Typically, experiments are
performed by presenting stimuli nasally or temporally, but the angle under
which the few-photon pulses are presented varies between 7 deg and 23 deg. Here
we combine a $3$-dimensional eye model with retinal rod density measurements
from literature in a ray tracing simulation to study the optimal eye alignment
conditions and necessary alignment precision. We find that stimuli, directed at
the eye's nodal point, may be best presented under an inferior angle of 13.1
deg with respect to the visual axis. Defining a target area on the retina with
a radius of 0.5 mm around the optimum location, we find the horizontal and
vertical angular precision should be better than 0.85 deg given a horizontal
and vertical translational precision of 1 mm and a depth translational
precision of 5 mm.

Abstract: Quantum dots stand out as the most advanced and versatile light-matter
interface available today. Their ability to deliver high-quality, high-rate,
and pure photons has set benchmarks that far surpass other emitters. Yet, a
critical frontier has remained elusive: achieving these exceptional
capabilities at telecom wavelengths, bridging the gap to fiber-optic
infrastructure and scalable silicon photonics. Overcoming this challenge
demands high quality quantum materials and devices which, despite extensive
efforts, have not been realized yet. Here, we demonstrate waveguide-integrated
quantum dots and realize a fully quantum-coherent photon-emitter interface
operating in the original telecommunication band. The quality is assessed by
recording transform-limited linewidths only 8 % broader than the inverse
lifetime and bright 41.7 MHz emission rate under 80 MHz $\pi$-pulse excitation,
unlocking the full potential of quantum dots for scalable quantum networks.

Conclusion: 该方法将器件设计从固定制造约束转向辐射工程，为超快可重构光子学开辟了新途径。

Abstract: When coherent light interacts with an ordered lattice whose periodicity is
comparable to its wavelength, constructive interference produces a diffraction
pattern as in crystallography, where x-rays are employed to reveal atomic
structures. By asking 'when' the diffractive object exist, rather than 'where',
we implicitly introduce time as a design parameter, thus enabling the creation
of spatio-temporal metalattices. In these structures, temporal modulation of
optical properties complements the spatial patterning, unlocking advanced
functionalities such as dynamic reconfigurability, nonreciprocal behavior,
coherent amplification, and tailored spectral response. However, for these
effects to be relevant an extreme temporal modulation of the refractive index
is necessary. In this work, we realize a two-dimensional spatio-temporal
metalattice by integrating a physically patterned spatial modulation with an
orthogonal temporal lattice induced by interfering ultrafast pulses, using
highly nonlinear, low-index transparent conducting films. While the optical
pumps experience a uniform medium, the lattice emerges through a strongly
enhanced and internally generated third harmonic signal. The transient lattice
shows comparable diffraction efficiency to the physical structure and is also
dynamically reconfigurable via a broad range of parameters, including pump
pulse delay, incidence angle, and wavelength, offering exceptional versatility
for ultra-fast transient lithography and photon manipulation in both momentum
and frequency. This approach shifts device design from fixed fabrication
constraints to radiation engineering, opening new pathways towards ultrafast
reconfigurable photonics.

Abstract: On-chip optical architectures that enable angle-resolved spectroscopy are
essential for advancing photonic platforms towards low-volume, scalable, and
cryo-compatible devices. Here, we introduce spatially resolved momentum-space
imaging using arrays of 3D-printed microlenses directly integrated onto
semiconductor optical microcavities. Each microlens functions as an independent
optical element with a high numerical aperture (approx. 0.95), enabling
parallel back focal plane imaging across, in our implementation, 64 distinct
locations. This approach eliminates the need for bulky microscope objectives
while maintaining broad wavevector access, even under cryogenic conditions. We
demonstrate its versatility across various cavity systems, including dielectric
planar resonators, GaAs-based polariton microcavities, and CdTe platforms
supporting nonequilibrium Bose-Einstein condensation of exciton-polaritons. The
microlenses not only enhance collection efficiency but also enable tightly
focused excitation, yielding an order of magnitude reduction in condensation
thresholds compared with conventional setups. Our results establish 3D-printed
microlens arrays as a compact, versatile, integrated platform for
next-generation angle-resolved spectroscopy in nanophotonics and quantum
materials.

Abstract: Skyrmionic patterns of optical fields have recently emerged across diverse
photonic platforms. Here, we show that such textures also arise in the
polarization eigenstates of light propagation through flat dielectric devices
with an engineered, space-dependent optic-axis orientation. We focus on
two-dimensional periodic structures, where propagation through multiple devices
maps onto quantum dynamics on a synthetic optical lattice. Adopting the
condensed-matter framework, a spatial period defines an effective Brillouin
zone, and polarization eigenstates can be grouped in two bands, with the role
of energy played by the opposite phase delay. When such eigenstates exhibit
skyrmionic textures, the corresponding lattice model shows the topology of a
Chern insulator. These structures result from the interaction between the
optical field and the medium and do not reflect a topological structure of the
medium itself. We validate these concepts in a system of three tunable
liquid-crystal metasurfaces. Using quantum process tomography based on
supervised machine learning, we reconstruct the polarization eigenmodes over
one spatial period. We identify configurations of the devices' parameters that
lead to topologically non-trivial bands, where we directly observe skyrmionic
eigenpolarization textures. Along the analogy with condensed matter, we also
extract local observables of lattice models, such as the Berry curvature and
the quantum metric. We finally report a numerical simulation of an all-optical
quantum Hall effect emerging when light propagates through a sequence of such
devices, arranged so as to mimic the effect of an external force on the
lattice.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种使用差分泵浦玻璃芯片进行高次谐波生成的新方法，通过优化亚毫米级气体限制，显著扩展了发射截止能量，比传统相位匹配方法提高了一倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高次谐波生成中扩展发射截止能量与转换效率之间的权衡问题，传统方法通过增加驱动波长会牺牲效率，而使用更高激光强度则需要处理高等离子体密度和短传播距离的挑战。

Method: 使用差分泵浦玻璃芯片实现亚毫米级最优气体限制，分别用800nm和1500nm多周期脉冲驱动高次谐波生成，并结合三维传播模拟验证实验结果。

Result: 实验证明截止能量扩展了传统相位匹配方法的两倍，突破了多周期场的现有记录。高能光子不仅在时间上局限于驱动脉冲的前沿，在空间上也因驱动场在介质内传播的重塑而形成离轴贡献。

Conclusion: 气体限制对于高次谐波生成至关重要，截止谐波的有效相位匹配仅在短传播长度下发生。这些发现有助于深入理解不同机制下的高次谐波生成过程。

Abstract: Attosecond light sources based on high-order harmonic generation (HHG)
constitute to date the only table-top solution for producing coherent broadband
radiation covering the spectral range from the extreme ultraviolet to the soft
X-rays. The so-called emission cutoff can be extended towards higher photon
energies by increasing the driving wavelength at the expense of conversion
efficiency. An alternative route is to overdrive the process by using higher
laser intensities, with the challenging requirement of interacting with higher
plasma densities over short propagation distances. Here, we address this
challenge by using a differentially pumped glass chip designed for optimal gas
confinement over sub-mm lengths. By driving HHG with multicycle pulses at
either 800 nm or 1500 nm, we demonstrate a cutoff extension by a factor of two
compared to conventional phase matching approaches and surpassing the present
record using multicycle fields. Our three-dimensional propagation simulations,
in excellent agreement with the experiment, confirm that gas confinement is
crucial since efficient phase matching of cutoff harmonics occurs only for
short propagation lengths. Additionally, we show that the high photon energy
component is not only temporally confined to the leading edge of the driving
pulse, but also spatially confined in the near-field to an off-axis
contribution due to reshaping of the driving field along propagation inside the
medium. Our findings contribute to the fundamental understanding of HHG across
different regimes.
