Usage of interference filters in combination with white light-emitting diode (LED) illumination enables the quantitative study of optical phenomena such as refraction, interference (e.g., Newton's rings), Fresnel and Fraunhofer diffraction. Thus, we propose an instrument that can be used to illustrate the theoretical foundations of an undergraduate optics course and beyond."}

This attractive prospect is hindered by the lack of any topological detector, a challenging problem due to the non-orthogonal nature of the topological invariant (N). Here we demonstrate the first deterministic detector for Skyrmionic topologies of light using a deep diffractive optical neural network. Our network uses two independent processing channels of 5 diffractive layers each to map incoming topologies to spatially separated Gaussian channels from which N can be detected. We overcome the complexity of the training by using a spatial mode basis rather than pixels, reducing the training variables by x1000 compared to current methods. We use the detector on an input set of 81 input topologies, showing high accuracy even in the presence of significant levels of noise. Finally, to show the practical utility of the device, we transmit and receive an image encoded in a 14-level topological alphabet with no discernible cross-talk. Our work offers a new paradigm for the emergent field of diffractive optical networks and can easily be extended to other forms of optical topologies, setting a clear pathway for their deployment in real-world applications."}

However, owing to their broad and polarization-insensitive spectral features, the nanostructures reported so far displayed a limited color tunability and were unsuitable for other applications such as sensing. Herein, we report bismuth nanogratings with polarization-sensitive and narrow plasmon resonances (Q > 10). They were fabricated on the $cm^2$ scale following a lithography-free approach: conformal pulsed laser deposition of bismuth onto the reflective and transparent nanostructured layers of DVDs. We characterized their specular reflectance for different orientations of the plane of incidence, angles of incidence, and polarizations of light. When light is polarized in the plane perpendicular to the lines, plasmon resonances occur and shift across the visible-to-near infrared upon changing the angle of incidence. In contrast, no such resonances occur when light is polarized in the plane parallel to the lines. This results in well-contrasted, polarization-sensitive colors, which are iridescent for the former orientation of polarization, and not for the latter. Resonances strongly shift upon changing the refractive index of the surrounding medium (> 500 nm/RIU), resulting in a marked change in the plasmonic color, e.g., from green in air to red in water. This showcases the potential of these nanogratings for dynamic polarized color generation and colorimetric sensing."}

OAM is generated by breaking the cross-sectional mirror symmetry of the nanowire, which creates a non-Hermitian system. This is achieved by replacing the central airhole of the hollow nanowire with a cluster of 6 overlapping circular air holes with rotational offset relative to the hexagonal cross-sectional profile of the nanowire. The design parameters were then further optimized in Finite Element Method using an inverse design method to maximize the normalized OAM order |l|. We were able to realize of a cavity mode with |l| = 5.7, a mode purity of about 97%, and a Q-factor of ~250. This marks the first OAM generating active photonic device design falling within a sub-micron footprint, with additional novelties of being single component and materialistically homogeneous."}

We introduce a generalized SP effect relying on finite periodic arrays whose elements possess individually tunable polarizabilities, allowing us to explore higher-order SP radiation. By controlling the amplitude and phase of each of the elements, we show through rigorous theory the ability to create an SP steering device. In particular, we explore the active tuning capabilities of doped graphene, and thermally driven phase-change materials, which we compare with standard passive plasmonic structures made of gold and silver. Our results establish programmable electron-driven light sources and spectroscopic probes spanning the terahertz-to-visible range, advancing tunable metasurfaces for next-generation electron-photon technologies."}

Comments welcomed", "summary": "We present a cardinal solution for the long-standing and fundamental problem associated with the adiabatic, reversible, and controlled excitation of both dark and bright solitons in Kerr micro-resonators with normal group velocity dispersion. Our findings stem from the inclusion of a localised non-Hermitian potential, which we use to drastically reshape the characteristic collapsed snaking structure associated with such solitons. Consequently, we demonstrate a novel snaking-free bifurcation landscape where solitons of all possible widths are continuously connected via the dynamic change of the cavity detuning, and hence dissipative localised states of unprecedentedly high pump-to-comb conversion efficiencies can be excited in an adiabatic, deterministic, and reversible fashion. Our fundamental discovery has practical implications of paramount importance for frequency comb generation in all-normal dispersion cavities, which are key to comb generation in most spectral regions away from the telecom bands."}

However, it remains a challenge for a system to combine the required operational speed and accuracy of eye tracking with a technology that has a small enough form factor and weight to be easily integrated into a user-friendly headset. By using small, lightweight hardware comprising a high frame rate microLED array and fast single pixel detector, we report a model eye tracking system based on single pixel tracking and a specially developed set of deep learned illumination patterns. This model system is used to demonstrate eye tracking with an angular accuracy of better than one degree and a measurement rate of up to $3.59 \\,$ kHz."}

Here, we present a scalable architecture that implements arbitrary-order EPs via a recurrent network comprising a single nanomechanical resonator and unlimited virtual resonators. We experimentally realize mechanical EPs up to the seventh order and confirm this architecture's scalability. Moreover, we reveal that the fundamental noise component and the measured signal share the same system coupling channel and thus undergo identical root-response amplification near EPs of arbitrary order, consistent with our signal-to-noise ratio measurements. Our work establishes a general platform for exploring higher-order EP-based phenomena while clarifying the fundamental boundary of non-Hermitian sensitivity enhancement across diverse physical systems."}
