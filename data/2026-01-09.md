TL;DR: 提出一种新型电光传感器，将神经电信号直接转换为光信号，利用光的超高带宽和复用能力，实现超越传统电接口的大规模并行神经记录


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前神经接口无法全面捕捉大脑活动，因为神经元密度极高且可扩展性有限。尽管已有微型化神经探针和高通道密度技术，但基本设计约束仍限制了同时记录通道的大幅扩展

Method: 集成片上光子微谐振器与石墨烯层，无需基因编码光学指示剂或组织改造，直接将神经信号转换为放大的光调制，通过片上波导传输。采用波分复用技术将波长选择性传感器阵列复用到单个总线波导上

Conclusion: 建立了光学复用神经记录的概念验证，为实现可扩展、高密度神经接口铺平道路，适用于神经科学研究和临床应用

Abstract: Large-scale neural recording with high spatio-temporal resolution is essential for understanding information processing in brain, yet current neural interfaces fall far short of comprehensively capturing brain activity due to extremely high neuronal density and limited scalability. Although recent advances have miniaturized neural probes and increased channel density, fundamental design constraints still prevent dramatic scaling of simultaneously recorded channels. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel electro-optic sensor that directly converts ultra-low-amplitude neural electrical signals into optical signals with high signal-to-noise ratio. By leveraging the ultra-high bandwidth and intrinsic multiplexing capability of light, this approach offers a scalable path toward massively parallel neural recording beyond the limits of traditional electrical interfaces. The sensor integrates an on-chip photonic microresonator with a graphene layer, enabling direct detection of neural signals without genetically encoded optical indicators or tissue modification, making it suitable for human translation. Neural signals are locally transduced into amplified optical modulations and transmitted through on-chip waveguides, enabling interference-free recording without bulky electromagnetic shielding. Arrays of wavelength-selective sensors can be multiplexed on a single bus waveguide using wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM), greatly improving scalability while maintaining a minimal footprint to reduce tissue damage. We demonstrate detection of evoked neural signals as small as 25 $μ$V with 3 dB SNR from mouse brain tissue and show multiplexed recording from 10 sensors on a single waveguide. These results establish a proof-of-concept for optically multiplexed neural recording and point toward scalable, high-density neural interfaces for neurological research and clinical applications.

TL;DR: 提出首个端到端可微分优化框架，用于几何波导AR显示器的非序列光线追踪与多层薄膜涂层联合优化，显著提升光效率和均匀性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 几何波导是光学透视AR显示器的有前景架构，但其性能受限于非序列光传输和偏振相关多层薄膜涂层的联合优化困难。

Method: 开发端到端可微分优化框架，耦合非序列蒙特卡洛偏振光线追踪与可微分传输矩阵薄膜求解器，采用内存节省策略，支持自动化层剪枝和拓扑优化。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅实现了波导内系统级高维涂层优化，还扩展了可微分光学在新一代光学设计中的应用范围。

Abstract: Geometric waveguides are a promising architecture for optical see-through augmented reality displays, but their performance is severely bottlenecked by the difficulty of jointly optimizing non-sequential light transport and polarization-dependent multilayer thin-film coatings. Here we present the first end-to-end differentiable optimization framework for geometric waveguide that couples non-sequential Monte Carlo polarization ray tracing with a differentiable transfer-matrix thin-film solver. A differentiable Monte Carlo ray tracer avoids the exponential growth of deterministic ray splitting while enabling gradients backpropagation from eyebox metrics to design parameters. With memory-saving strategies, we optimize more than one thousand layer-thickness parameters and billions of non-sequential ray-surface intersections on a single multi-GPU workstation. Automated layer pruning is achieved by starting from over-parameterized stacks and driving redundant layers to zero thickness under discrete manufacturability constraints, effectively performing topology optimization to discover optimal coating structures. On a representative design, starting from random initialization within thickness bounds, our method increases light efficiency from 4.1\% to 33.5\% and improves eyebox and FoV uniformity by $\sim$17$\times$ and $\sim$11$\times$, respectively. Furthermore, we jointly optimize the waveguide and an image preprocessing network to improve perceived image quality. Our framework not only enables system-level, high-dimensional coating optimization inside the waveguide, but also expands the scope of differentiable optics for next-generation optical design.

### [3] [Modifications to Image Phase Alignment Super-sampling Produce up to 4.4 times Increased Image Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04391)
*James N. Caron*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: ImPASS是一种通过组合多幅低分辨率图像生成高分辨率图像的计算方法，改进后的算法将图像分辨率提升至衍射极限的2.57倍以下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ImPASS方法在图像对齐精度和去卷积方面存在限制，这些因素影响了最终图像分辨率的提升潜力。需要改进算法以突破现有技术限制。

Method: 改进ImPASS算法，包括：1）提高图像对齐精度；2）优化盲去卷积参数。通过测量相对位移、上采样、对齐组合图像，最后进行盲去卷积。

Result: 改进后的算法使图像分辨率提升因子达到4.41（相对于原始图像），超越衍射极限因子达2.57。与之前版本相比，分辨率提升因子达到1.81。

Conclusion: 系统物理特性尚未成为限制因素，算法仍有进一步改进空间。ImPASS技术能够显著突破成像系统的衍射极限。

Abstract: Image Phase Alignment Super-sampling (ImPASS) is a computational method for combining displaced low-resolution images into a single high-resolution image. The general steps include measuring the relative displacements, up-sampling, aligning and combining the images, followed by a blind deconvolution. Previous ImPASS studies have shown that the resulting image resolution can significantly subceed the diffraction limit of the imaging system. Characteristics that potentially limit the processed image resolution include optical parameters, detector noise, image alignment accuracy, or deconvolution parameters. In this report, modifications have been made to the algorithm to improve the image alignment accuracy and deconvolution. Applications of the modified algorithm improved image resolution by a factor up to 1.81. Compared to the original image resolution, the modified ImPASS achieved a resolution improvement factor up to 4.41 while subceeding the diffraction limit by a factor of 2.57. This suggests that limitations imposed by the physical properties of the system have not yet been reached, and further improvement of the algorithm is warranted.

TL;DR: 热退火处理金薄膜可显著增强纳米尺度真空间隙中的近场辐射热传递，最大提升约40%，这源于退火改变了金薄膜的低频介电损耗，从而增强了过阻尼等离子体表面模式的耦合。

Abstract: Thermal annealing is a widely used thin-film processing technique for modifying interfacial optical losses and electronic scattering in plasmonic materials. Here, we investigate how thermal annealing of gold thin films deposited on silicon carbide substrates influences interfacial near-field radiative heat transfer across nanoscale vacuum gaps. Using experimentally measured dielectric functions for annealed and unannealed Au films, we evaluate the spectral and total radiative heat flux between Au/SiC interfaces within a fluctuational electrodynamics framework.
  We show that annealing-induced changes in the low-frequency dielectric losses of Au significantly alter evanescent electromagnetic coupling at the interface, leading to enhancements of up to ~40\% in the total near-field radiative heat transfer at separations of tens of nanometers. Mode-resolved analysis reveals that this enhancement originates from strengthened coupling of overdamped plasmonic surface modes, which are highly sensitive to thin-film processing and interfacial microstructure. These results demonstrate that standard thermal annealing provides a practical route for tuning interfacial radiative heat transfer in metallic thin-film systems without modifying material composition or geometry, offering guidance for the design and interpretation of nanoscale thermal and plasmonic interfaces.

### [5] [Photonic Temporal Illusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04466)
*Grigorii Ptitcyn,Diego M. Solís,M. S. Mirmoosa,Nader Engheta*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: 提出"时间幻象"概念：通过时空变化的有效参数模拟任意时间不变结构的响应，用常规介质调制实现奇异材料的光学行为


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然界中具有特殊光学性质的材料稀少且难以获得，需要新方法来按需合成材料响应

Method: 提出时间动态框架，通过精心编程的时空变化有效参数来模拟任意时间不变结构的响应，具体通过调制常规介质的介电常数来实现

Result: 理论上证明该方法能复制奇异材料的光学行为，控制瞬态响应（如降低高Q值谐振器的时间常数），并通过调制与激励之间的失谐实现额外功能

Conclusion: 时间幻象范式扩展了时空变化系统的能力，为按需合成材料响应提供了强大途径，开辟了光学和波物理的新理论和实验方向

Abstract: Materials with unusual optical properties are central to advanced control of light. Yet, in nature, such materials may be exceedingly rare and often difficult to obtain. To overcome this limitation, here we introduce the concept of temporal illusion: A temporally dynamic framework in which carefully programmed temporal variations in effective parameters generate responses akin to those of, in principle, any arbitrary time-invariant structure. We theoretically demonstrate that proper modulation of the permittivity of a conventional dielectric in space and time replicates the optical behavior associated with exotic materials. Besides, we reveal that, beyond steady-state effects, temporal illusion also enables control over transient responses, for instance, by effectively lowering the time constant of high-quality-factor resonators, therefore, allowing faster energy accumulation. Moreover, by incorporating detuning between modulation and excitation, we show that the framework unlocks additional functionalities. The temporal illusion paradigm thus broadens the capabilities of space-time varying systems, offering a powerful route to synthesize material responses on demand and paving the way for new theoretical and experimental directions in optics and wave physics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于非均匀间隔模式单频梳的快速高灵敏度光谱系统，通过简化自外差架构实现了比双频梳光谱高一个数量级的灵敏度，可在纳秒时间尺度单次测量中解析弱分子光谱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 频率梳光谱学在分子光谱研究中取得了显著进展，但对于时间分辨研究，灵敏度和测量速度是关键性能指标。长期以来，这两个参数之间存在权衡，因为噪声抑制的需求限制了性能提升。

Abstract: Frequency comb spectroscopy has significantly advanced molecular spectroscopy across scientific research and diverse applications. Among its key performance metrics especially for time-resolved studies, sensitivity and measurement speed are paramount. However, a long-standing compromise between these parameters arises from the need for noise reduction. Here, we introduce a comb spectroscopy system that overcomes this limitation using a single frequency comb of non-uniformly spaced modes. The comb is generated using an extremely simple setup, composed of a continuous-wave (CW) fiber laser and a single-sideband phase modulator (SSM). Our approach delivers optical-to-radio-frequency conversion comparable to dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS) but through a simplified self-heterodyning architecture. By leveraging the intrinsic mutual coherence of the comb, this design achieves a noise-equivalent absorption coefficient (NEA) of 5.0*10^(-6) Hz^(-1/2)--an order-of-magnitude improvement over state-of-the-art DCS, coupled with long-term stability. The system resolves weak molecular overtone spectra on nanosecond timescales, in a single-shot measurement, at a signal-to-noise ratio of 128. This integration of high sensitivity, resolution, and speed resolves the core trade-off that has long constrained time-resolved spectroscopic analysis.

TL;DR: 首次实验展示了单片集成的硅光子OEO转换器，具有可重构非线性传输和片上RF增益，为光电子计算和光学神经网络提供了紧凑的构建模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OEO转换器是实现低延迟、高能效光子计算的关键，能够提供非线性激活和片上光信号再生功能。然而，需要开发单片集成、与代工厂兼容的硅光子OEO转换器。

Method: 开发了两种单片集成的硅光子OEO转换器：负载电阻型（高速变体）和电流注入型（高增益变体）。每个器件将锗光电探测器与微环调制器集成，在硅光子代工厂制造。

Conclusion: 硅光子OEO转换器是紧凑、与代工厂兼容的构建模块，为可扩展的光电子计算和光学神经网络奠定了基础，通过降低电容和提高电光效率可实现亚pJ/bit操作。

Abstract: Optical-electrical-optical (OEO) converters are key primitives for low-latency, energy-efficient photonic computing because they enable nonlinear activation and optical signal regeneration on chip. We report two monolithically integrated silicon-photonic OEO converters-load-resistor (high-speed variant) and current-injection (high-gain variant) types-fabricated at a silicon photonics foundry. Each device combines a germanium photodetector with a micro-ring modulator (MRM). The converters exhibit reconfigurable nonlinear transfer functions and measurable on-chip RF OEO gain. The RF OEO gain scales linearly with the MRM bias power, with slopes of 0.10 mW^-1 (load-resistor of 10 kΩ) and 1.4 mW^-1 (current-injection), enabling a gain > 1 region at practical bias powers (~10 mW and ~1 mW, respectively). Eye diagrams confirm clear openings up to 4 Gb/s for a high-speed load-resistor variant with a 500-Ω load. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental demonstration of a monolithically integrated, foundry-fabricated silicon-photonic load-resistor type OEO converter exhibiting reconfigurable nonlinear transfer and on-chip RF OEO gain. In the carrier-injection device, the activation slope exceeds unity, yielding 3.9 dB extinction-ratio regeneration. Short-pulse measurements yield 3-dB bandwidths of 1.49 GHz, 160 MHz (load-resistor of 500 Ω and 10 kΩ), and 76 MHz (current-injection), consistent with the RF data. Energy analysis shows an energy-bandwidth trade-off (RC-limited for load-resistor vs. lifetime-limited for injection) and outline routes to sub-pJ/bit operation via reduced capacitance and improved EO efficiency. These results establish silicon-photonic OEO converters as compact, foundry-compatible building blocks for scalable optoelectronic computing and optical neural networks.

Abstract: Microwave photonic (MWP) filters are essential components in microwave systems due to their wide bandwidth, low loss, and immunity to electromagnetic interference. A sharp transition band is critical for precise spectral shaping and interference suppression, yet conventional MWP filters face challenges in achieving both sharp transitions and high reconfigurability. Adaptive MWP filters with sharp transition based on a transversal filter structure using an optical microcomb source are demonstrated in this paper. Four different types of single-band MWP filters with roll-off rates up to ~32.6 dB/GHz and a minimum shape factor of ~1.15 are achieved. In addition, simply through designing tap coefficients, band-pass filters with tunable centre frequencies ranging from 5 GHz to 15 GHz and dual-band MWP filters with various filter response are demonstrated without changing any hardware, where sharp transition is also validated. The adaptive filters with sharp transition presented in this paper offer a stable and highly reconfigurable solution for applications requiring stringent spectral selectivity, such as next-generation wireless networks, high-resolution radar imaging, and advanced biomedical photonic sensing.

Abstract: Diffractive neural networks have recently emerged as a promising framework for all-optical computing. However, these networks are typically trained for a single task, limiting their potential adoption in systems requiring multiple functionalities. Existing approaches to achieving multi-task functionality either modify the mechanical configuration of the network per task or use a different illumination wavelength or polarization state for each task. In this work, we propose a new control mechanism, which is based on the illumination's angular spectrum. Specifically, we shape the illumination using an amplitude mask that selectively controls its angular spectrum. We employ different illumination masks for achieving different network functionalities, so that the mask serves as a unique task encoder. Interestingly, we show that effective control can be achieved over a very narrow angular range, within the paraxial regime. We numerically illustrate the proposed approach by training a single diffractive network to perform multiple image-to-image translation tasks. In particular, we demonstrate translating handwritten digits into typeset digits of different values, and translating handwritten English letters into typeset numbers and typeset Greek letters, where the type of the output is determined by the illumination's angular components. As we show, the proposed framework can work under different coherence conditions, and can be combined with existing control strategies, such as different wavelengths. Our results establish the illumination angular spectrum as a powerful degree of freedom for controlling diffractive networks, enabling a scalable and versatile framework for multi-task all-optical computing.

Abstract: Biological and biomedical samples are routinely examined using focused two-photon (2P) fluorescence microscopy due to its intrinsic axial sectioning and reduced out-of-focus bleaching. However, 2P imaging often requires excitation intensities that can damage samples through ionization and radical formation. Additionally, the lateral resolution of 2P microscopy is lower compared to linear one-photon (1P) fluorescence microscopy. Widefield 2P microscopy, using cameras, holds promise for reducing photo-toxicity while maintaining high image acquisition rates. Widefield imaging trades the high power and short integration times of sequential single point scanning for the low power and extended integration times of parallel detection across millions of pixels. However, generating effective axial sectioning over arbitrarily large fields of view (FOVs) has remained a challenge. In this work, we introduce 2P Random Illumination Microscopy (2P-RIM), an easy-to-implement 2P widefield technique, that achieves low photo-damage, fast imaging, micrometric axial sectioning, and enhanced lateral resolution for arbitrarily large FOVs. By using widefield speckled illuminations in conjunction with an image standard deviation matching algorithm, 2P-RIM demonstrated multicolor imaging over FOVs greater than 200 um, lateral resolution 220 nm, axial sectioning 2 um, and peak excitation powers about 10 times lower than those used in focused laser scanning microscopy.

Abstract: Structured optical materials provide a promising platform for photonic quantum information processing in free space. Beam splitters, a fundamental building block of photonic circuits, have recently been demonstrated in free space using geometric-phase optical elements. These devices coherently mix circularly-polarized transverse modes of freely-propagating optical fields, including modes carrying orbital angular momentum. In this work, we investigate liquid-crystal metagratings as electrically tunable beam splitters for transverse-momentum optical modes. By exploiting the voltage-controlled birefringence of liquid-crystal metasurfaces, we experimentally tune the splitting ratio of the device and thereby control the degree of two-photon interference between indistinguishable photons. At the output, photons are spatially resolved on different regions of a time-resolved single-photon-sensitive detector, enabling the reconstruction of coincidence maps in the Fourier plane. This approach is readily scalable and enables highly parallel coincidence measurements across a large number of optical modes.

Abstract: Conventional infrared (IR) imaging techniques depend on IR cameras based on narrow-bandgap semiconductors, which offer limited spectral bandwidth, coupled with a separate lens. Recently, advances in nonlinear flat optics have opened a novel pathway for converting IR signals into the visible through nonlinear generations, enabling the direct visualisation of IR images using standard visible cameras. However, the narrow spectral bandwidth and the requirement for an additional lens remain the key challenges. Here, we address both issues via a novel adaptive and multifunctional IR-to-visible imaging platform offering tunable bandwidth and focusing simultaneously. We utilise sum-frequency generation (SFG) to convert IR light into the visible, by introducing a pump beam modulated by a spatial light modulator (SLM) to construct a virtual metalens enabling precisely controlled focusing of the generated nonlinear optical field. As a result, we demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally an optical focusing mechanism with a tunable focal length, achieved by varying the pump and signal wavelengths and modulating the phase distribution. Furthermore, since the focal length depends on the input signal wavelength, the imaging plane position varies accordingly, indicating a promising potential for the multispectral IR imaging applications. Our upconversion platform delivers SLM-controlled, programmable multispectral focusing for next-generation IR imaging, opening new avenues in the fields of computational and multispectral imaging techniques.

Abstract: We study near-field radiative transfer of energy, angular momentum, and linear momentum between a nanoparticle and a plate consisting of magnetic Weyl semimetals, and demonstrate that these can be efficiently tuned by a relative angle between the Weyl node separations. This tunability originates from the coupling between the particle-induced rotational Poynting vector and the nonreciprocal surface plasmon polaritons supported by the plate. Remarkably, we uncover a counterintuitive regime in which both energy and angular momentum transfer are maximized when the Weyl node separations are antiparallel rather than parallel. This arises from optimal mode matching between the rotation direction of the particle's circular heat flux and the propagation direction of the surface plasmon polaritons in the antiparallel configuration.

Abstract: Black materials play a critical role in applications such as image registration, camera calibration, stray light suppression, and visual design. Although many such materials appear similarly dark under diffuse illumination, their reflectance behavior can differ substantially as a function of viewing and lighting geometry. Ultra-black materials achieve exceptional light attenuation but are often constrained by cost and mechanical fragility, motivating the evaluation of more robust and accessible alternatives. In this study, we employ a gonimetric measurement system to capture the isotropic bidirectional reflectance distribution function of a range of black materials, including the ultra-black reference Vantablack, commercially available alternatives such as Musou Black and black velvet, and standard matte black coatings. We analyze their reflectance characteristics in terms of diffuse and specular scattering, as well as total integrated scatter, to quantify angular-dependent reflection. In addition, we compare their perceptual appearance using physically based rendering driven by the measured BRDFs and a psychophysical evaluation of perceived darkness. Together, these analyses provide a comprehensive assessment of black materials that links reflectance properties to visual appearance and perceptual performance, enabling informed material selection for optical applications.

Abstract: The realization of Hawking radiation in optical analogs has historically focused on kinematic observables, such as the effective temperature determined by the horizon's surface gravity. A complete thermodynamic description, however, necessitates a rigorous definition of entropy and irreversibility, which has remained elusive in Hamiltonian optical systems. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing an operational entropy for solitonic event horizons, derived from the spectral partitioning of the optical field into coherent solitonic and incoherent radiative subsystems. We demonstrate that the emission of resonant radiation, mediated by the breaking of soliton integrability due to higher-order dispersion, serves as a fundamental mechanism for entropy production. Numerical simulations of the generalized nonlinear Schrodinger equation confirm that this process satisfies a generalized second law, where the change in total entropy is non-negative. These results establish optical event horizons as consistent nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems, offering a new pathway to explore the information-theoretic aspects of analog gravity in laboratory settings.
