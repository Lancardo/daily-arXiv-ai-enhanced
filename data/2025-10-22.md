*Michael Shur,Gregory Aizin*

Main category: physics.optics

Method: 通过均匀栅极调制在等离子体晶体单元中诱导周期性载流子浓度变化，求解带阻尼的广义Mathieu方程，研究非线性等离子体参数共振和频率倍增效应。

Result: 在77K低温下，高幅值栅极泵浦能够实现频率倍增并引发参数不稳定性；在低迁移率等离子体晶体中，通过周期性短脉冲激发可实现RF到THz转换。

Conclusion: AlGaN/GaN低高等离子体晶体显示出作为可调谐、紧凑THz源的潜力，为太赫兹技术应用提供了新途径。

Abstract: The plasma oscillations in high-mobility field-effect transistors (HEMTs)
have emerged as a key physical mechanism for manipulating electromagnetic
radiation in the sub-terahertz (sub-THz) and THz frequency ranges. These
collective electron excitations can be excited and tuned electrically offering
a compelling route to compact, integrable components for a wide range of
next-generation technologies, including sixth-generation (6G) wireless
networks, high-resolution biomedical and chemical spectroscopy, industrial
process monitoring, and advanced security and defense systems. For these
applications, plasmonic crystals -- periodic arrays of many strongly coupled
FET channels -- are particularly promising. In this work, we report on a new
class of collective excitations in plasmonic crystals termed rotonic plasmons,
which arise at plasmonic mode crossings and exhibit a parabolic dispersion law
reminiscent of soft-mode and roton-like spectra. We show that uniform gate
modulation across plasmonic crystal unit cells induces periodic variations in
the sheet carrier concentration and, consequently, in the plasma frequency.
This time-periodic modulation drives nonlinear plasmonic parametric resonances
enabling RF-to-THz conversion. By solving the generalized Mathieu equation with
damping, we demonstrate that high-amplitude gate pumping enables frequency
multiplication and, at cryogenic temperatures (77K) leads to parametric
instabilities due to enhanced electron mobility. In plasmonic crystals with
lower mobility, RF-to-THz conversion can instead be realized via periodic
short-pulse excitation, a regime we introduce as Time-Domain Frequency
Multiplication (TDFM). Investigation of AlGaN/GaN low-high plasmonic crystals
confirm their potential as tunable, compact THz sources.

### [2] [Comment on "Brilliant source of 19.2 attosecond soft X-ray pulses below the atomic unit of time"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17949)
*Meng Han*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: 该评论文章指出Ardana-Lamas等人的预印本在重新分析氪原子阿秒条纹实验数据时存在物理和技术问题，质疑其表征19.2阿秒光脉冲结果的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者旨在揭示Ardana-Lamas等人对原始实验数据的重新分析中存在的关键问题，包括未考虑俄歇电子贡献、未使用滤波器去除低次谐波以及未补偿固有脉冲啁啾等。

Method: 通过比较作者最近的氪原子阿秒条纹实验，指出原分析在物理和技术上的缺陷，特别是对单原子轨道假设的质疑。

Result: 发现原分析存在显著问题：未考虑俄歇电子、未过滤低能谐波、未补偿脉冲啁啾，这些因素导致对光脉冲特性的错误表征。

Conclusion: 由于这些物理和技术问题，Ardana-Lamas等人声称的近乎无啁啾脉冲表征结果的有效性受到严重质疑。

Abstract: A recent preprint by Ardana-Lamas et al. (Ref. [1], arXiv:2510.04086)
re-analyzes the data set of the attosecond streaking experiment on krypton
atoms originally reported in Phys Rev X 7, 041030 (2017) [2], and claims the
characterization of a 19.2 attosecond light pulse with an overall photon flux
of 4.8*10^10 photons per second. In this comment, we highlight a series of
physical and technical issues concerning both the original experiment [2] and
the new characterization [1]. Specifically, without accounting for the
contribution of Auger electrons or employing filters to remove low-energy
harmonics and compensate for the intrinsic pulse chirp, the authors attribute
the measured photoelectrons predominantly to the 3d inner-shell orbital of
krypton and claim to have retrieved a nearly chirp-free pulse based on the
single atomic orbital. In comparison with our recent attosecond streaking
experiments on krypton atoms, these physical and technical issues raise
significant doubts about the validity of the characterization results.

### [3] [Terahertz Switch Using an Array of Subwavelength Metallic Holes-coupled-disks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18009)
*Sanaz Zarei*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: 在室温下实现了太赫兹波的宽带开关，使用可重构的亚波长金属孔耦合盘阵列，通过机械位移实现光传输的重构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种在室温下工作、具有高对比度和宽带特性的太赫兹波开关器件，以满足太赫兹通信和成像系统的需求。

Method: 采用周期性排列的金属孔膜与金属盘阵列精确对准的结构，通过机械位移改变两者相对位置来调控光传输特性。

Result: 在942 GHz频率下实现了89.4 dB的高对比度开关性能，半高全宽带宽为288 GHz，且工作频率和带宽可通过几何尺寸设计进行缩放。

Conclusion: 该可重构亚波长结构为太赫兹波开关提供了一种有效的室温工作解决方案，具有高对比度和宽带特性，且频率可调。

Abstract: Broadband switching of terahertz waves at room temperature is demonstrated
using a reconfigurable subwavelength metallic hole coupled disk array. The
interaction between a metallic membrane featuring periodically arranged
circular holes and a substrate bearing a correspondingly periodic array of
metallic disks - precisely aligned at their centers - significantly enhances
the light coupling within each individual metallic structure, leading to an
improved optical transmission and the appearance of a new transmission peak. By
mechanical displacement of the metallic membrane with respect to the substrate
with metallic disks, the light transmission through the structure can be
reconfigured. The device exhibits a polarization-insensitive high-contrast
switching performance of 89.4 dB at 942 GHz. The full-width at half-maximum
bandwidth of the switch is 288 GHz. By proper design of the device's geometric
dimensions, the operation frequency and bandwidth of the switch can be scaled.

### [4] [Mechanically Reconfigurable Terahertz Bandpass Filter Based on Double-Layered Subwavelength Metallic Rods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18023)
*Sanaz Zarei*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: 提出了一种机械可重构的双层亚波长金属结构，用于实现频率可调的太赫兹带通滤波，通过调节层间距实现0.81-1.32 THz的频率调谐，传输效率大于98%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 太赫兹可调带通滤波器在超光谱成像仪、小型化光谱仪和高速无线通信系统等关键应用中具有重要需求。

Method: 采用机械可重构的双层亚波长金属结构，通过改变金属层之间的垂直间距（20μm到4μm）来实现频率调谐，同时研究垂直和横向层间位移对偏振特性的影响。

Result: 滤波器工作频率从0.81 THz调谐到1.32 THz，半高全宽带宽从209 GHz变化到135 GHz，最大传输效率大于98%，品质因子在3.88到9.77之间。

Conclusion: 该方案由于具有大调谐范围、易于调谐机制、结构简单以及与制造材料和工艺的兼容性，在太赫兹应用中具有重要前景。

Abstract: Tunable bandpass terahertz filters are demanded in various key applications
such as hyperspectral imagers, miniaturized spectrometers, and high-speed
wireless communication systems. Here, a mechanically reconfigurable
double-layered subwavelength metallic structure is presented for
frequency-agile terahertz transmission bandpass filtering. The theoretically
demonstrated polarization-insensitive filter shows remarkable performance
metrics. By varying the vertical interlayer spacing of the metallic layers from
20 um to 4 um, the operation frequency tunes from 0.81 THz to 1.32 THz, and the
full width at half maximum bandwidth changes from 209 GHz to 135 GHz, with
maximum transmission efficiency greater than 98% and quality factor ranging
between 3.88 and 9.77. A larger variation range of the vertical interlayer
spacing leads to an enhanced frequency tuning range of the filter. Furthermore,
simultaneous vertical and lateral interlayer displacements can provide
polarization-dependent behavior for the filter. The underlying physical
mechanism governing the filter's frequency response and tuning capability is
analyzed by examining the electromagnetic field distributions within the
double-layered subwavelength metallic structure and its Fabry-Perot-like
behavior. The presented scheme holds significant promise for many terahertz
applications due to its large tuning range, easy tuning mechanism, simple
structure, and compatibility with fabrication materials and processes.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: 提出了一种无损测量光子集成电路中光学损耗和增益的通用方法，利用非线性光学器件作为功率鉴别器，精度优于0.1dB，可应用于不同光子平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光子集成电路中缺乏无损表征光学损耗和增益的工具，因为集成电路无法无损拆卸，这限制了电路设计和性能优化。

Method: 利用非线性光学器件作为光学功率鉴别器，通过检索PIC内部的损耗和增益信息来实现无损测量。

Result: 方法精度优于0.1dB，能够表征单个光纤-芯片耦合面和一般未知器件的损耗，成功测量了量子PIC中异质集成平衡光电二极管的真实片上量子效率。

Conclusion: 该方法可在不同光子平台上实现，对于理解复杂光子电路中的增益和损耗至关重要，有助于优化电路设计并创建具有可预测、可重复性能的大规模系统。

Abstract: Integrated photonics has undergone tremendous development in the past few
decades, transforming many fields of study in science and technology. Loss and
gain are two fundamental elements in photonic circuits and have direct impacts
on nearly all key performance metrics. Surprisingly, the tools to characterize
the optical loss and gain inside photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are very
limited. This is because, unlike free-space or fiber optics, integrated
circuits cannot be nondestructively disassembled. Here, we report a universal
method to see inside the photonic integrated circuits and measure loss and gain
on the component level nondestructively. The method leverages nonlinear optical
devices as optical power discriminators to retrieve the loss and gain
information inside the PICs. Our method has a precision better than 0.1 dB, and
can characterize the loss of individual fiber-chip coupling facet and general
unknown devices under test. As a demonstration of applications, we measured the
true on-chip quantum efficiency of a quantum PIC consisting of heterogeneously
integrated balanced photodiodes, a critical building block for integrated
quantum technology. Our method can be implemented on different photonic
platforms, and can be used to understand gain and loss in complex photonic
circuits, which is essential to optimize circuit design and to create
large-scale systems with predictable, reproducible performance.

### [6] [Robust and Hyper-Efficient Multi-dimensional Optical Fiber Semantic Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18230)
*Yuxuan Xiong,Ziwen Zhou,Jixing Ren,Jingze Liu,Zheng Gao,Ting Jiang,Xuchen Hua,Gengqi Yao,Yuqi Li,Mingming Zhang,Hao Wu,Siqi Yan,Ming Tang*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: 提出了一种多维语义通信框架，将高级语义特征直接映射到光的多维物理特性上，在单模光纤中实现了接近1000 bit/s/Hz的等效频谱效率和36%误码率下的高保真重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能和沉浸式媒体对通信的需求超越了比特级精度，需要语义感知能力。传统光学系统专注于语法精度，存在显著效率问题。

Method: 通过语义逻辑与光子通道的协同设计，将高级语义特征直接映射到光的正交物理维度（频率、偏振、强度），在单模光纤中实现语义通信。

Result: 实现了接近1000 bit/s/Hz的等效频谱效率，在物理层符号错误率超过36%时仍能保持高保真重建，且仅需单端强度检测即可完成完整语义解调。

Conclusion: 这项工作为下一代数据密集型计算建立了超高效、容错性强的光网络验证路径，通过语义编码与物理层调制的深度集成设计显著降低了系统复杂性和成本。

Abstract: The growing demands of artificial intelligence and immersive media require
communication beyond bit-level accuracy to meaning awareness. Conventional
optical systems that focused on syntactic precision suffer significant
inefficiencies. Here, we introduce a multi-dimensional semantic communication
framework that bridges this gap by directly mapping high-level semantic
features onto the orthogonal physical dimensions of light, frequency,
polarization, and intensity, within a multimode fiber. This synergistic
co-design of semantic logic and the photonic channel achieve an unprecedented
equivalent spectral efficiency approaching 1000 bit/s/Hz. Moreover, it
demonstrates profound resilience, maintaining high-fidelity reconstruction even
when the physical-layer symbol error rate exceeds 36%, a condition under which
conventional communication systems fail completely. Crucially, this deeply
integrated co-design of semantic encoding and physical-layer modulation enables
full semantic demodulation with only single-ended intensity detection,
therefore significantly reducing system complexity and cost. This work
establishes a validated pathway toward hyper-efficient, error-resilient optical
networks for the next generation of data-intensive computing.

### [7] [Galilean Invariance in the Characterization of Light Drag in Moving Atomic Vapor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18249)

Abstract: Light experiences drag effects when it propagates through a moving medium.
The study of light drag has provided foundational insights into light-matter
interactions. While longitudinal drag has been extensively characterized,
transverse drag, where the medium moves perpendicular to the light's
propagation, is subtler and requires advanced techniques for detection. In this
work, we experimentally investigate transverse drag in a highly dispersive
slow-light medium using non-degenerate Zeeman electromagnetically induced
transparency (EIT) in rubidium vapor. By systematically comparing
configurations where the light beam and the medium serve as the moving frame,
we leverage Galilean invariance to analyze transverse light-drag in this
optical context. Thus, we provide a platform for future tests of fundamental
principles on strong experimental grounds, which offers promising applications
in precision velocimetry, accelerometry, quantum information, and light storage
technologies.

### [8] [Geometric Manifold Statistics of Turbulence-Impacted Beam Propagation and Compensation in Optical Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18295)

Conclusion: 提出的流形统计框架有效量化了湍流对光束统计的影响，证明了PMMA补偿器通过耦合偶极相互作用能够部分恢复湍流畸变光束的统计相干性。

Abstract: The present study extends the analysis of turbulence-affected beam statistics
through a manifold-based statistical framework that unifies probabilistic
modeling with geometric interpretation. The spatial intensity distributions,
distorted by dynamic turbulence, are represented using Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMMs), whose probability landscapes are refined via Kernel Density Estimation
(KDE) applied to pixel-level intensity data across temporal frames. The
temporal evolution of turbulence is quantified by monitoring the variation of
the unnormalized volumetric integrals under the GMM surfaces, providing a
continuous measure of power redistribution within the optical field.
Experimental investigations were carried out under four propagation conditions:
turbulence-free reference, turbulence only, turbulence with a single PMMA
compensator, and turbulence with dual PMMA compensators. To assess statistical
dissimilarity, Affine-Invariant Riemannian Metric (AIRM) distances were
computed between the covariance representations of successive frames, capturing
the geometric evolution of beam topology in the space of Symmetric Positive
Definite (SPD) matrices. Complementary topological distance analyses, performed
with respect to the initial frame of each set, revealed distinct signatures of
turbulence-induced aberrations and their progressive mitigation through
dielectric compensation. The observed reduction in inter-frame distance metrics
confirms the ability of coupled dipole interactions within PMMA slabs to
partially restore statistical coherence in turbulence-distorted optical beams.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效增强流动成像的像素分辨率，提高标量梯度估计的准确性，具有高速成像的可扩展性。

Abstract: In fluid flow imaging, intensity gradients are a good measure of spatial
variations in scalar properties, which play an important role in controlling
transport processes. However, current flow imaging techniques exhibit
system-limited spatial resolutions, thus inhibiting the ability to accurately
detect intensity gradients. To address this challenge, we present a method and
system, inspired by Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM), which can be
implemented in dynamic flow imaging to enhance pixel resolution and, thereby,
the estimation of scalar gradients. We utilize sub-pixel-scale patterned light
matching the system pixel scale and multi-frame imaging that creates
quasi-static images over four frames, with scalability for high-speed imaging.
These multi-frame images are then processed using a bespoke recombination
algorithm that produces a new image with twice the pixel resolution compared to
the original images. The sub-pixel spatial-resolution enhancement capabilities
are shown with static images and dynamic fluid flow, for which enhancement in
the flow gradient is demonstrated.

Abstract: The growing complexity of reconfigurable photonic circuits, made possible by
the established maturity of silicon photonic foundries, demands efficient
strategies to monitor and actively control the optical functionality at
runtime. In this work, we show that both the readout of integrated sensors and
the driving of actuators can be performed with a time-multiplexed addressing
scheme, that drastically reduces the number of electrical connections required
to interface the chip to the external hardware. This approach is achieved by
monolithically integrating the electronic circuits needed to
serialize/deserialize the feedback action directly on the photonic chip. We
experimentally validate the proposed strategy with a silicon photonic coherent
adder, showing that such time-multiplexed control does not introduce any
penalty in the optical functionality. The circuit operation is then validated
in a joint communication and sensing scenario, where the coherent adder is used
to simultaneously receive a 25 Gbps high-speed transmission and to measure the
phase difference between the input light beams.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 激光和光子器件通常由非线性方程描述，这些方程往往无法解析求解。自1960年Maiman实现第一个激光器以来，计算机模拟就与激光技术的发展同步推进，为理解非线性动力学提供了关键工具。

Method: 通过计算机模拟数值求解多种光子器件的模型方程，包括激光器、参数调制激光器、注入激光器、Kerr谐振器、可饱和吸收体和光学参量振荡器。

Abstract: We all know that the first laser device was realised by Theodore Maiman at
Hughes Labs in 1960. Less known is that the very first computer simulations of
the relaxation oscillations displayed by Maiman's laser were also performed in
1960 on a digital IBM 704 computer. The reason is that lasers and almost all
photonic devices are described by nonlinear equations that are more often than
not impossible to be solved analytically, i.e. on a piece of paper. Since then
the development and applications of lasers and photonic devices has progressed
hand in hand with computer simulations and numerical programming. In this
review we introduce and numerically solve the model equations for a variety of
devices, lasers, lasers with modulated parameters, lasers with injection, Kerr
resonators, saturable absorbers and optical parametric oscillators. By using
computer simulations we demonstrate stability and instability of nonlinear
solutions in these photonic devices via pitchfork, saddle-node, Hopf and Turing
bifurcations; bistability, nonlinear oscillations, deterministic chaos, Turing
patterns, conservative solitons; bright, dark and grey cavity solitons;
frequency combs, spatial disorder, spatio-temporal chaos, defect mediated
turbulence and even rogue waves. There has been a one-to-one correspondence
between computer simulations of all these nonlinear features and laboratory
experiments with applications in ultrafast optical communications, optical
memories, neural networks, frequency standards, optical clocks, future GPS,
astronomy and quantum technologies. All of this has been made possible by
'novel insights into spatio-temporal dynamics of lasers, nonlinear and quantum
optical systems, achieved through the development and application of powerful
techniques for small-scale computing' (2011 Occhialini Medal and Prize of the
Institute of Physics and Societa' Italiana di Fisica).

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用光电化学刻蚀和微转移印刷技术制造GaN基谐振腔LED的新方法，显著改善了LED的光谱线宽和角度发散特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 谐振腔LED具有优异的时间和空间相干性，对于微显示应用非常重要，但传统制造方法存在限制。

Method: 采用光电化学刻蚀和微转移印刷技术，通过系统优化刻蚀条件实现高选择性刻蚀，并将GaN芯片转移到目标衬底上形成两种蓝色RCLED。

Result: 成功制备的RCLED光谱线宽从传统LED的32nm减小到约5nm，峰值波长随电流密度变化从9.3nm减小到小于1nm，远场发散角可降至52度。

Abstract: Resonant cavity LEDs (RCLEDs) exhibit excellent temporal and spatial
coherence with narrow spectral linewidth and small divergence angle, which is
of great importance for micro-displays. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel
method to create GaN-based RCLEDs by using photo-electrochemical etching and
micro-transfer printing (MTP) technology. Through systematic optimizing of the
etching conditions, highly selective etching of an InGaN multiple quantum well
sacrificial layer is achieved with parasitic etching of adjacent layers being
completely suppressed. The roughness of the underside of the exfoliated GaN
film is only 3.3 nm. Raman spectroscopy shows that the residual stress in the
released material is reduced from 0.74 GPa for the as-grown sample to -0.15
GPa. Using the MTP method, GaN coupons with a deposited upper dielectric mirror
were transferred onto target substrates covered with either an Al mirror or
dielectric distributed Bragg reflector to form two types of blue RCLEDs. The
electroluminescence spectra of the two RCLEDs show a much narrower linewidth,
reduced from 32 nm in the conventional LED to ~5 nm, together with stable peak
wavelength with increasing current density, with the shift reduced from 9.3 nm
to less than 1 nm. The far-field pattern is influenced by the bottom mirror,
and the far-field divergence angle can be decreased to only 52{\deg} by
matching the cavity and the quantum well exciton modes. This scalable approach
is highly promising for the realization of compact resonant cavity devices and
their use in displays and in communications.

Motivation: 研究时空介质的拓扑性质面临根本挑战：其显著特性源于打破时空对称性，但这种打破又模糊了拓扑表征。

Method: 使用洛伦兹变换到与行波调制共动的参考系，识别出新的变量中守恒的联合宇称-时间反演对称性，该对称性强制Zak相的量子化。

Conclusion: 该方法使得能够研究行波调制晶体的拓扑性质并预测时空界面态，揭示了时间变化效应带来的独特现象。

Abstract: Studying the topology of spatiotemporal media poses a fundamental challenge:
their remarkable properties stem from breaking spatial and temporal symmetries,
yet this same breaking obscures their topological characterization. Here, we
show that space-time symmetries persist in crystals with travelling-wave
modulation, enabling the study of their topological properties and the
prediction of spatiotemporal interface states. Using a Lorentz transformation
to the frame comoving with the modulation, we identify a conserved joint
parity-time-reversal symmetry in the new variables that enforces the
quantization of the Zak phase, elevating it to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological
invariant. We then calculate the associated interface states and uncover unique
features arising from time-varying effects, including selective directional
excitation, propagation along moving boundaries, frequency-converted replicas,
and broadband amplification even in the absence of momentum gaps.

Abstract: Nanoporous gold (npAu) has emerged as a potential candidate for many optical
applications exploiting its large surface to volume ratio and high broadband
absorption. However, the physical origin of its enhanced visible and near
infrared absorption remained unclear and till now was not explicable by
simplified models. Here, we have employed leveled-wave approximants to simulate
the optical response of realistic npAu structures. First, our simulations
reproduced well the experimental absorption spectra. Second, we identify
multiple resonances in the gaps between dangling ligaments that occur at the
top and bottom surfaces of npAu films as the key contribution to the broadband
absorption. These resonances at the surface of npAu cannot be captured by bulk
effective medium models and should be considered separately as a surface
effect. The additional absorption due to dangling ligaments contributes up to
70 % to overall absorption of npAu. Our results provide deeper insights into
the absorption behavior of npAu, indicating promising avenues for
photocatalysis and sensing applications.

Abstract: III-V semiconductor nanolight sources with deep-subwavelength dimensions
($<<$1 ${\mu}$m) are essential for miniaturized photonic devices such as
nanoLEDs and nanolasers. However, these nanoscale emitters suffer from
substantial non-radiative recombination at room temperature, resulting in low
efficiency and ultrashort lifetimes ($<$100 ps). Previous works have
predominantly studied surface passivation of nanoLEDs under optical pumping
conditions, while practical applications require electrically driven nanoLEDs.
Here, we investigate the influence of surface passivation on the efficiency and
high-speed modulation response of electrically pumped III-V GaAs/AlGaAs
nanopillar array LEDs. Surface passivation was performed using ammonium
sulphide chemical treatment followed by encapsulation with a 100 nm silicon
nitride layer deposited via low-frequency plasma-enhanced chemical vapour
deposition. Time-resolved electroluminescence measurements reveal differential
carrier lifetimes (${\tau}$) of ~0.61 ns for nanoarray LEDs with pillar
diameters of ~440 nm, a record-long lifetime for electrically driven GaAs-based
nanopillar arrays. Under low injection conditions, the devices exhibited
carrier lifetimes of ~0.41 ns, indicating successful suppression of
non-radiative effects and a low surface velocity, ranging from
$S$~0.7$\times$10$^4$ cm/s to 2.7$\times$10$^4$ cm/s. This reveals a potential
high internal quantum efficiency $IQE$~0.45 for our nanoLEDs operating under
very high injection conditions, limited only by Auger recombination and
self-heating effects at high current density. These miniaturized nanoLEDs with
high radiative recombination efficiency and sub-ns modulation response pave the
way for optical data communications, energy efficient optical interconnects,
AR/VR displays, and neuromorphic computing applications.

Abstract: We introduce a topological photonic-crystal fiber that embeds a short
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain and supports two edge supermodes. Using
full-vector modal analysis and a coupled generalized nonlinear Schroedinger
equation, we show that each supermode provides an independent nonlinear channel
with a distinct broadening mechanism: the even supermode features two
zero-dispersion wavelengths and yields degenerate four-wave mixing sidebands,
whereas the odd supermode is all-normal-dispersion and generates a smooth, flat
ANDi-type continuum. Exciting a single core prepares a coherent superposition
of the two supermodes; cross-phase modulation and inter-parity four-wave mixing
then enable energy transfer across detunings inaccessible to either mode alone,
producing the broadest and flattest spectrum with new short wavelengths
components. Our results establish topology-enabled modal control as a scalable
knob for engineering supercontinuum generation in short SSH topological fibers.

Abstract: Supercontinuum light sources are widely used for applications ranging from
imaging to sensing and frequency comb stabilization. The most common mechanisms
for their generation rely on cubic nonlinearities, for instance in crystals,
optical fibers, and integrated photonics. However, quadratic supercontinuum
generation (QSCG) offers potential for enhanced energy efficiency and broader
spectral coverage because of the typically much stronger nonlinearity and
ability to achieve both coherent up- and down-conversion via three-wave mixing
processes. Despite such potentials, demonstrations of QSCG in integrated
photonic waveguides have been sparse and have barely surpassed their cubic
counterparts in terms of spectral coverage and energy-efficiency. Here, we
introduce a new dispersion engineering principle and experimentally demonstrate
purely quadratic supercontinuum generation in lithium niobate nano-waveguides
substantially outperforming previous demonstrations in integrated photonics. In
one device, by engineering a near-zero dispersion profile and using a single
poling period for quasi-phase matched saturated second-harmonic generation, we
achieve robust and energy efficient multi-octave QSCG with only femtojoules of
pump pulse energy. In another device, we use a flat dispersion profile with two
distant zero crossings of group velocity dispersion (GVD) to achieve broadband
difference-frequency generation (DFG) for extending the spectral coverage
further into the mid-IR and cover the entire transparency window of lithium
niobate from 350 nm to 5000 nm. Our results showcase how DFG-assisted QSCG can
access hard-to-access spectral regions in an energy-efficient fashion by
properly utilizing dispersion engineering and quasi-phase matching.
