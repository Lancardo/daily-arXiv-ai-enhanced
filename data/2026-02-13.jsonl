Yet, the narrow phase-matching bandwidth of conventional crystals has largely confined studies to specific wavelengths, leaving research on broadband tunable sources underexplored. Here, we employ a non-critical phase-matched lithium niobate (LN) crystal to generate widely tunable photon pairs. The generated near-infrared (NIR) photon pairs exhibit a high coincidence-to-accidental ratio (CAR > 20 dB) and are tunable across the 800-1600 nm range. We further showcase the utility of NIR photon pairs in spectroscopy by detecting carbon monoxide (CO) gas absorption. This approach will facilitate the design of advanced LN-based photonic experiments."}

Here we demonstrate coherent perfect tunneling at an exceptional point in a passive one-dimensional waveguide cascade with three coupled interfaces. Using a waveguide-invariant scattering framework, we show that the suppression of a selected output channel originates from a directional scattering degeneracy rather than from resonance or absorption collapse. This exceptional-point condition emerges when interference between boundary-induced feedback loops promotes a simple zero of the scattering response to a second-order degeneracy. As a direct consequence, fixed coherent excitation produces a robust quartic leakage law within a transparency-dominated tunneling window. These results establish directional degeneracy as a general mechanism for loss-tolerant tunneling enabled by exceptional points across a broad class of wave systems."}

By considering electric and magnetic dipole modes and the interactions between different numbers of the nearest resonators, we obtain the Bloch Hamiltonians and the corresponding tight-binding models and analyze the band diagrams, spatial structure of the eigenmodes, and their localization, revealing quadratic degeneracies in the vicinity of high-symmetry points in the absence of bianisotropy and the emergence of in-gap states localized at a domain wall upon the introduction of bianisotropy. Finally, we visualize the Berry curvature distributions to study the topological properties of the considered models."}

An important special case is the phase domain problem, where blocks of a crystal are displaced with sharp jumps at domain walls. The strong-phase, here defined as beyond $\\pm π/2$, generates split Bragg peaks and dense fringe structure for which classical iterative solvers often stagnate or return different solutions from different initialisations. Here, we introduce an unsupervised Fourier Vision Transformer (Fourier ViT) to solve this block-phase, multi-domain phase-retrieval problem directly from measured 2D Bragg diffraction intensities. Fourier ViT couples reciprocal-space information globally through multiscale Fourier token mixing, while shallow convolutional front and back-ends provide local filtering and reconstruction. We validate the approach on large-scale synthetic datasets of Voronoi multi-domain crystals with strong-phase contrast under realistic noise corruptions, and on experimental diffraction from a $\\mathrm{La}_{2-x}\\mathrm{Ca}_x\\mathrm{MnO}_4$ nanocrystal. Across the regimes considered, Fourier ViT achieves the lowest reciprocal-space mismatch ($χ^2$) among the compared methods and preserves domain-resolved phase reconstructions for increasing numbers of domains. On experimental data, with the same real-space support, Fourier ViT matches the iterative benchmark $χ^2$ while improving robustness to random initialisations, yielding a higher success rate of low-$χ^2$ reconstructions than the complex convolutional neural network baseline."}
