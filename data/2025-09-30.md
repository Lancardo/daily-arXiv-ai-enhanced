TL;DR: 飞秒激光脉冲因其能在极端时空尺度上限制光能，成为材料加工的独特工具，具有高精度和最小热影响区的特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索超短脉冲激光在材料加工中成功的原因，识别限制加工精度和大规模应用的基本过程，并提出克服这些限制的策略。

Method: 通过分析飞秒激光与材料相互作用的基本物理过程，包括电子-声子耦合时间尺度、非线性材料相互作用等。

Result: 飞秒激光能够实现亚微米级的加工精度，热影响区仅几百纳米，同时能够实现独特的材料激发和弛豫路径。

Conclusion: 超短脉冲激光在材料加工中具有独特优势，但需要解决精度限制和大规模应用的问题，未来有望突破激光材料加工的终极极限。

Abstract: Ultrashort (femtosecond, fs) laser pulses have fascinating properties as they
allow to confine optical energy on extreme scales in space and time. Such
fs-laser pulsed beams can be seen as spatially thin slices of intense light
that are radially and axially constrained to the micrometer scale, while
simultaneously propagating at the extremely high speed of light. Their high
peak intensities and their short time lapse makes such laser pulses unique
tools for materials processing, as their duration is shorter than the time
required to transfer absorbed optical energy, via electron-phonon coupling,
from the electronic system of the solid to its lattice. Hence, the laser pulse
energy remains localized during the interaction and does not spread via
diffusion into the area surrounding the irradiated region. As one consequence,
the fs-laser thus offers increased precision for material modification or
ablation accompanied by a reduced heat-affected zone of only a few hundred
nanometers. On the other hand, the high laser peak intensities can enable
nonlinear material interactions that are rendering unique material excitation
and relaxation pathways possible. In this chapter, we briefly review the
reasons for the enormous success of ultrashort pulse lasers in materials
processing - both for the processing of the surface or in the bulk of solids.
We identify the underlying fundamental processes that can limit the precision
or the up-scaling of the laser processing towards large volumes, areas, or
processing rates. Strategies to overcome such limitations will be outlined and
questions on the ultimate limits of laser material processing will be answered.

Abstract: High power lasers are used for a variety of manufacturing processes on time
and length scales that cover many orders of magnitude and on different
materials. The variety of processes achievable through laser-material
interaction results from numerous coupled, nonlinear physical phenomena.
Simulation models can be used to gain process understanding, explain
experimentally observed phenomena, and optimize or design processes. However,
the inherent complexity and diversity of the phenomena make modeling a
challenging task.
  Within this chapter, a universal model is presented that accurately simulates
a broad spectrum of processes, including welding, additive manufacturing,
cutting, ablation, drilling, and surface structuring, encompassing both
continuous wave and ultrashort pulsed lasers and their interaction with various
materials. Starting from the fundamental principles of conservation of mass,
momentum, and energy, a continuum mechanical framework is introduced that
captures the main multiphysical effects. A numerical solution using the Finite
Volume Method is presented and validated against benchmark problems where
detailed experimental data are available. Macroscopic examples with continuous
wave lasers include keyhole drilling and collapse under stationary illumination
as well as melt pool dynamics and pore formation in copper welding. At the
microscopic level, copper ablation with femtosecond pulses is simulated.
  Finally, a set of real-world applications is shown, where the model helps to
explain and optimize industrial phenomena and defects. Examples include deep
penetration welding of steel with dynamic beam shaping, multilayer additive
manufacturing via powder bed fusion, and ultrashort pulsed drilling of micro
vias in dielectric materials.

Abstract: Monte Carlo simulations are commonly used to calculate photon reflectance,
absorptance, and transmittance of multi-layer scattering and absorbing media,
but they can quickly become prohibitively expensive as the number of layers
increases. In this study, we show that although a plain neural network suffers
from the curse of dimensionality and fails to yield acceptable predictions of
multilayer media, we introduce a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on the
same Monte Carlo simulation dataset to achieve accurate prediction with great
acceleration. Our RNN architecture solves the curse of dimensionality by
keeping the number of inputs into the network constant for any number of
layers. We demonstrate the general applicability with three diverse case
studies of multilayer architectures: tissue, radiative cooling paint, and
atmospheric clouds, achieving 1-2 orders of magnitude acceleration over Monte
Carlo simulations while providing up to one order of magnitude less error than
a plain neural network. This recurrent neural network approach enables
affordable photon multi-layer modeling, optimization, and high throughput
screening for broad applications across dosimetry, atmospheric studies, and
spectrally selective radiative coatings.

Result: 确定了在共传播和反向传播配置下，真空信号占主导地位所需的激光强度和真空压力条件

Conclusion: 为未来旨在探测真空中光-光散射的全光学实验提供了定量指导

Abstract: We study the conditions required to distinguish laser-induced nonlinear
quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects in vacuum from competing signals due to
interactions of laser pulses with ionized residual gas. The latter is
inevitably present in vacuum chambers where experiments are performed because
the vacuum is never perfect and there is always some residual pressure. The
rarefied gas contribution is modeled statistically using the 1D-1V
Vlasov-Maxwell system, while vacuum nonlinearities are described within the
weak-field expansion of the Heisenberg-Euler effective action. In both cases,
photon spectra from wave-mixing processes are evaluated by solving numerically
the resulting partial differential equations using a semi-Lagrangian scheme. We
consider short pulses in co- and counter-propagating configurations, allowing
us to identify the laser intensities and vacuum pressures for which the vacuum
signal dominates. These results provide quantitative guidance for future
all-optical experiments aiming to detect light-by-light scattering in vacuum.

Abstract: Nanodiamonds (NDs) are key materials for building nanoscale quantum sensing,
imaging and communication devices. Scalable configuration of single NDs on
heterogeneous platforms, forming photonic quantum source arrays, will be an
essential solution towards realizing next-generation practical and industrial
quantum devices. However, NDs are challenging to manipulate because their size,
shape and surface chemistry vary substantially. Here, we show a simple method
based on electrostatic-trapping to rapidly and reliably pattern single ND
arrays on arbitrary substrates at scale. Our method, which uses carefully
engineered microscale hole templates and electrostatic force, captures single
NDs across 8-inch wafers with 82.5% yields within 5 min. Systematic
experimental and theoretical studies show the number of deposited NDs primarily
depends on the diameter of the hole trap. The method is compatible with mature
CMOS technologies, enabling the mass production of scalable and integrable
quantum devices. This advancement is expected to accelerate the
commercialization and industrial adoption of ND-based technologies.

Abstract: Sculpting light across its independent degrees of freedom-from orbital
angular momentum to the discrete wavelengths of optical frequency combs-has
unlocked vast communication bandwidth by enabling massively parallel
information channels. However, the Shannon-Hartley theorem sets a hard limit by
tying channel capacity to the trade-off between SNR and rate, a central
challenge in communication. Inspired by lock-in amplification in electronics,
we encode data on THz optical burst carriers so the signal resides beyond the
conventional noise band, yielding exceptional robustness. By leveraging a
programmable all-degree-of-freedom (All-DoF) modulator, we generate a
spatiotemporal topological comb (ST-Comb) that structures light into a vast,
highentropy state space for high-dimensional information encoding. Crucially,
we find that the associated topological winding number is preserved under
diverse perturbations, ensuring stable information encoding and retrieval. This
paradigm illustrates how structured light can simultaneously expand channel
dimensionality and maintain robustness, charting a pathway to chip-scale,
reconfigurable photonic platforms for the PHz era, while also opening
previously inaccessible regimes of light-matter interaction.

Abstract: Metasurfaces have emerged as a powerful platform to control free-space light
at the subwavelength scale, enabling applications in sensing, lasing, nonlinear
optics, and quantum photonics. However, their practical deployment is hindered
by two key limitations: a tradeoff between low-Q resonances and weak amplitude
contrast, and their predominantly static nature allowing only passive
functionalities. These challenges are further aggravated in the
application-relevant mid-infrared (mid-IR) range, where the lack of suitable
low-loss materials and the strong absorption of common substrates such as
silicon oxide or sapphire severely constrain performance and scalability. Here,
we address these issues with actively tunable single-crystalline silicon
membrane metasurfaces that combine high-Q resonances, strong amplitude
contrast, and wafer-scale fabrication compatible dimensions for high throughput
manufacturing. Our platform achieves record-high measured Q-factors up to 3000
in the mid-IR spectrum, supporting efficient dynamic modulation through two
distinct schemes: (i) on-chip electro-thermal tuning via Joule heating,
sustaining 50% modulation depth at CMOS-compatible voltages and speeds up to
14.5 kHz, and (ii) ultrafast all-optical modulation via carrier generation in
silicon, reaching nanosecond response times and estimated sub-GHz modulation
rates. By uniting sharp resonances, strong contrast, large-scale
manufacturability, and dynamic tunability, our active silicon membrane
metasurfaces advance the frontier of mid-IR nanophotonics and open new
opportunities in sensing, free-space communication, thermal radiation
management, and quantum technologies.

Abstract: Optical cavities are widely used in modern science and technology to enable a
wide range of both quantum and classical applications. Recently, the growing
demand for miniaturization and high performance has fueled the exploration of
new fabrication methods beyond traditional polishing techniques and macroscopic
mirrors. Visible and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths are particularly important
for quantum applications, where achieving low-loss resonators is also more
challenging than in the telecom range, presenting unique challenges and
opportunities for microscopic cavity systems. Here, we present a novel
fabrication method for making NIR microcavities using buckled dielectric
membrane mirrors, achieving a record finesse of 0.9 million at 780 nm. We
demonstrated flexible device geometries, including singular mirrors and mirror
arrays, featuring radii of curvature ranging from 1 mm to 10 mm. The
fabrication process offers high uniformity, high yield, and robust performance
across a wide range of cavity lengths. Additionally, we can produce
easy-to-assemble microcavity packages, with a total volume of ~2 (4)
$\,\mathrm{mm}^3\,$, featuring optical modes with a linewidth of 5.16 MHz (570
kHz) and a free spectral range of 3.18 THz (150 GHz). Our results extend the
frontier of microcavity fabrication for classical and quantum photonic
technologies.

Abstract: Overcoming the trade-off between wide field of view (FOV) and compactness
remains a central challenge for integrating near-infrared (NIR) imaging into
smartphones and AR glasses. Existing refractive NIR optics cannot
simultaneously achieve ultra-wide angles above 100{\deg} and ultrathin total
track length (TTL) below 5 mm, limiting their use in portable devices. Here, we
present a wafer-level-manufactured meta-aspheric lens (MAL) that achieves a
101.5{\deg} FOV, 3.39 mm TTL, and F/1.64 aperture within a compact volume of
0.02 cubic centimeters. Unlike previous hybrid lenses with separate refractive
and diffractive components, our MAL features a fully integrated structure,
which enables a compact form factor. This integration also simplifies
fabrication, allowing high-throughput production via micrometer-level precision
alignment and bonding on a single wafer, with only one dicing step and no need
for additional mechanical fixtures. Furthermore, the design process explicitly
considers manufacturability and accurately models metalens dispersion, ensuring
that experimental performance matches simulated results. We validate our MAL
through both direct and computational imaging experiments. Despite its small
form factor, our scalable MAL demonstrates strong NIR imaging performance in
blood vessel imaging, eye tracking, and computational pixel super-resolution
tasks. This scalable MAL technology establishes a new benchmark for
high-performance, miniaturized NIR imaging and opens the door to
next-generation smartphone and AR optical systems.

Abstract: All-optical neural networks (AONNs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for
ultrafast and energy-efficient computation. These networks typically consist of
multiple serially connected layers between input and output layers--a
configuration we term spatially series AONNs, with deep neural networks (DNNs)
being the most prominent examples. However, such series architectures suffer
from progressive signal degradation during information propagation and
critically require additional nonlinearity designs to model complex
relationships effectively. Here we propose a spatially parallel architecture
for all-optical neural networks (SP-AONNs). Unlike series architecture that
sequentially processes information through consecutively connected optical
layers, SP-AONNs divide the input signal into identical copies fed
simultaneously into separate optical layers. Through coherent interference
between these parallel linear sub-networks, SP-AONNs inherently enable
nonlinear computation without relying on active nonlinear components or
iterative updates. We implemented a modular 4F optical system for SP-AONNs and
evaluated its performance across multiple image classification benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that increasing the number of parallel
sub-networks consistently enhances accuracy, improves noise robustness, and
expands model expressivity. Our findings highlight spatial parallelism as a
practical and scalable strategy for advancing the capabilities of optical
neural computing.

Abstract: A fully stabilized frequency comb is essential for precision metrology and
coherent optical synthesis. However, fully-stabilized frequency combs generally
require separate stages for supercontinuum generation (SCG) and
self-referencing, largely limiting their compactness. Here, enabled by the
low-threshold multi-octave supercontinuum generation and concurrent
third-harmonic generation in low-loss silicon nitride waveguides, we present a
novel approach to a self-referenced frequency comb source at 1 GHz repetition
rate spanning from the full visible (VIS) to the mid-infrared (MIR). Our
coherent comb is seeded by an all-polarization-maintaining ultrafast fiber
laser at 1556 nm, with a pulse duration of 73 fs at 1 GHz repetition rate. With
an injected energy of merely 110 pJ, the pulses propagate through
dispersion-engineered Si3N4 waveguides, generating supercontinuum spanning over
three octaves from 350-3280 nm i.e. 0.76 PHz of coherent bandwidth. Moreover,
the on-chip third harmonic generation provides a carrier envelope offset beat
note via f-3f with a signal-to-noise ratio of 43 dB. Fueled by the evolving
photonic integration providing possibilities of on-chip filtering and
photo-detectors, this approach for single-chip self-referencing of
high-repetition-rate frequency combs paves the way for ultrabroadband comb
sources with unprecedented compactness and field-readiness.

implementation remain limited. Here, we introduce a novel strategy for
achieving nonreciprocal coupling via nonlocal, nonlinear loss. We prove that
robust, broadband, and continuously tunable nonreciprocal coupling can be
realized by engineering the loss rate as a function of the state of a nonlocal
mode, as validated through effective Hamiltonian modeling and numerical
simulations. Our results suggest a promising route toward scalable,
power-independent, and potentially integrable nonreciprocal photonic systems,
with promising applications in non-Hermitian devices and topological photonics.

TL;DR: 提出了首个端到端的主动光子集成电路路由框架，统一处理波导和金属布线，显著减少通孔数量、设计规则违规和运行时间。

Abstract: The rising demand for AI training and inference, as well as scientific
computing, combined with stringent latency and energy budgets, is driving the
adoption of integrated photonics for computing, sensing, and communications. As
active photonic integrated circuits (PICs) scale in device count and functional
heterogeneity, physical implementation by manual scripting and ad-hoc edits is
no longer tenable. This creates an immediate need for an electronic-photonic
design automation (EPDA) stack in which physical design automation is a core
capability. However, there is currently no end-to-end fully automated routing
flow that coordinates photonic waveguides and on-chip metal interconnect.
Critically, available digital VLSI and analog/custom routers are not directly
applicable to PIC metal routing due to a lack of customization to handle
constraints induced by photonic devices and waveguides. We present, to our
knowledge, the first end-to-end routing framework for large-scale active PICs
that jointly addresses waveguides and metal wires within a unified flow. We
introduce a physically-aware global planner that generates congestion- and
crossing-aware routing guides while explicitly accounting for the placement of
photonic components and waveguides. We further propose a sequence-consistent
track assignment and a soft guidance-assisted detailed routing to speed up the
routing process with significantly optimized routability and via usage.
Evaluated on various large PIC designs, our router delivers fast, high-quality
active PIC routing solutions with fewer vias, lower congestion, and competitive
runtime relative to manual and existing VLSI router baselines; on average it
reduce via count by ~99%, user-specified design rule violation by ~98%, and
runtime by 17x, establishing a practical foundation for EPDA at system scale.

Abstract: We develop a general theory for twisted bilayer photonic crystals that takes
into account both far-field response and near-field coupling. The theory is
based on the framework of a generalized Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation
theory for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. A universal form for interlayer coupling
is derived, which relates the hopping strength to the Fourier transforms of the
Wannier functions in the single layer photonic crystal. For low energy states
at the K point in hexagonal lattices, the interlayer coupling reduces to that
in the Bistritzer-MacDonald model for graphene. As an example, we study a
twisted bilayer photonic crystal slab with air holes arranged in a honeycomb
lattice in each layer. The first order solution of our model predicts a
four-fold band splitting in the far-field spectrum compared to the single-layer
case, which is confirmed by numerical simulations. Moreover, our theory reveals
that for low energy states at K points, scattering towards the {\Gamma} point
via the moir\'e potential is suppressed. Based on our theory, we propose a
wide-angle, high-Q tunable flat band cavity by combining the bilayer at a large
twist angle with a Brillouinzone-folding perturbation within each layer. The
cavity behaves like a collection of quasi-bound states in the continuum with a
divergent density of states, with potential applications in nonlinear optics,
lasing and quantum optics.

Abstract: Advanced holographic techniques are increasingly demanded for high-capacity
and secure information processing. In this context, orbital angular momentum
(OAM) stands out as a powerful resource for optical multiplexing, offering
access to an unbounded set of orthogonal modes. To harness this potential,
metasurfaces, with their considerable ability to control light, have emerged as
key platforms for OAM-multiplexed holography. Nevertheless, conventional OAM
holography suffers from limited polarization engineering capabilities due to
the lack of chirality control in single-layer metasurfaces. Here, we introduce
a bi-layer metasurface architecture that realizes total angular momentum (TAM)
vectorial holography, where TAM represents the combination of spin angular
momentum (SAM, equivalent to polarization) and OAM of light. In contrast to
previous approaches, this scheme enables true polarization-OAM multiplexing,
facilitating the independent generation of vectorial holographic images for
each orthogonal TAM input state. This concept is validated numerically and
experimentally, confirming the feasibility of TAM vectorial holography. The
proposed scheme can be easily integrated with other recent holography
generation approaches, such as vector beam multiplexing and bidirectional
holography, thereby further expanding its multiplexing capability. This work
establishes a versatile framework for advanced full-vectorial holography,
showing how metasurfaces can unlock multiplexing strategies for emerging
photonic systems.

Abstract: Light-field imaging is an emerging paradigm in biomedical optics, offering
the unique ability to capture volumetric information in a single snapshot by
encoding both the spatial and angular components of light. Unlike conventional
three-dimensional (3D) imaging modalities that rely on mechanical or optical
scanning, light-field imaging enables high-speed volumetric acquisition, making
it particularly well-suited for capturing rapid biological dynamics. This
review outlines the theoretical foundations of light-field imaging and surveys
its core implementations across microscopy, mesoscopy, and endoscopy. Special
attention is given to the fundamental trade-offs between imaging speed, spatial
resolution, and depth of field, as well as recent advances that address these
limitations through compressive sensing, deep learning, and meta-optics. By
positioning light-field imaging within the broader landscape of biomedical
imaging technologies, we highlight its unique strengths, existing challenges,
and future potential as a scalable and versatile tool for biological discovery

Abstract: Traditional metasurface design is limited by the computational cost of
full-wave simulations, preventing thorough exploration of complex
configurations. Data-driven approaches have emerged as a solution to this
bottleneck, replacing costly simulations with rapid neural network evaluations
and enabling near-instant design for meta-atoms. Despite advances, implementing
a new optical function still requires building and training a task-specific
network, along with exhaustive searches for suitable architectures and
hyperparameters. Pre-trained large language models (LLMs), by contrast,
sidestep this laborious process with a simple fine-tuning technique. However,
applying LLMs to the design of nanophotonic devices, particularly for
arbitrarily shaped metasurfaces, is still in its early stages; as such tasks
often require graphical networks. Here, we show that an LLM, fed with
descriptive inputs of arbitrarily shaped metasurface geometries, can learn the
physical relationships needed for spectral prediction and inverse design. We
further benchmarked a range of open-weight LLMs and identified relationships
between accuracy and model size at the billion-parameter level. We demonstrated
that 1-D token-wise LLMs provide a practical tool to designing 2-D arbitrarily
shaped metasurfaces. Linking natural-language interaction to electromagnetic
modelling, this "chat-to-chip" workflow represents a step toward more
user-friendly data-driven nanophotonics.

Abstract: Reaching lasing in electrically pumped microdevices based on
solution-processed semiconductors poses a major scientific and technological
challenge. Halide perovskites offer a promising platform for electrical
injection, since their optically excited single-crystal cavities and
predesigned or postprocessed microstructures have exhibited low lasing
threshold. Indirect electrical pumping of a dual-cavity perovskite laser was
recently obtained, utilizing a well-established technological concept of
embedding a high-luminosity light-emitting diode (LED) with a high-gain medium
into an integrated device. Direct charge-carrier injection into a perovskite
LED excited by auxiliary short-, optical-pulses resulted into amplified
spontaneous emission. Other efforts for rational engineering of architectures
that allow for high charge-carrier density are still to demonstrate lasing.
Here, we develop a novel strategy for achieving direct electrical pumping of a
perovskite laser. We integrate a solution-grown CsPbBr3 microplate with
chemically inert single-walled carbon nanotube electrodes and embed them into
an optical microcavity. By cooling the microdevice down to 8 K at a constant
current, a perovskite p-i-n diode is formed that facilitates a balanced carrier
injection at high current densities. The perovskite microcavity diode operates
in the strong coupling regime, exhibiting polariton lasing under a direct
current of 65 uA.

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for creating a high-quality, sharply defined,
non-diffracting optical bottle beam by focusing a Bessel beam propagating
through a flat multi-level diffractive lens (MDL). This study highlights the
impact of the MDL illuminated by a Bessel beam with suppressed sidelobes
generated from a binary axicon. The resulting Bessel bottle beam exhibits a
series of low- or zero-intensity zones interleaved with high-intensity regions,
with variable periods ranging from 0.2 to 1.36 mm along the beam propagation.
The transverse intensity profiles of these regions remain shape-invariant over
long distances in free space, and thereby the non-diffracting range of the
micron-sized optical bottle beam exceeds 5 cm. We also observe that the
far-field output from the MDL illuminated by a Bessel beam offers advantages
over conventional focusing lenses. Furthermore, this technique can operate on
ultrafast timescales (from pico- to femtoseconds) due to the high damage
thresholds of the binary axicon and MDL, enabling the generation of high-power
optical bottle beams. Ultimately, our experimental approach paves the way for
various applications, including high-resolution biological imaging in turbid
media, particle manipulation, micromachining, and harmonic generation,
leveraging the spatial landscape of the optical bottle beam.

Abstract: A fully quantized description of a two-level system resonantly coupled with
an electromagnetic field (light) is among the central topics of quantum
electrodynamics, which is theorized by the quantum Rabi model. It is also a
fundamental issue of light-matter interactions. The rapid development of
two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) atomically-thin
semiconductors brings excellent great chance to test and demonstrate some basic
predictions by quantum optics theory in textbook, i.e., by the quantum Rabi
model. Such test and demonstration are of both scientific and technological
significance because of the quick emergence of the second quantum revolution.
In this Letter, we show a quantum optics demonstration of the
variable-temperature optical responses of the elementary excitations in
few-layer WSe2 flakes. It is unraveled that the variable-temperature
reflectance and fluorescence patterns of the elementary excitations (i.e., the
band-edge excitons) of monolayer, bilayer and hBN capped WSe2 match well with
the predictions by the quantum Rabi model under the rotating wave
approximation. Decoherence times, Rabi frequencies, and transition matrix
elements of the elementary excitations in these few-layer WSe2 flakes are found
to be all negatively correlated with temperature, and to show dependence on
layer number and capping layer. These findings may provide a novel perspective
for comprehending the fundamental quantum physical properties of
two-dimensional materials.

Result: 发现存在不稳定的"岛屿"区域，这是由孤子"内部模式"与"盆地"量子噪声之间的随机共振引起的。低功率种子可以抑制向多脉冲的转变，但种子功率增加会提高锁模能量阈值并产生更多不稳定区域。

Conclusion: 种子注入是增强耗散孤子能量可扩展性的有效方法，但需要仔细控制种子功率以避免引入新的不稳定性。

Abstract: We investigate the enhancement of the dissipative soliton energy scalability
by the injection of a low-power single-mode seed synchronized with a
chirped-pulse oscillator round-trip. It is demonstrated that a threshold-like
transition to multiple-pulse generation limits the maximum energies of
dissipative solitons, in agreement with the thermodynamic interpretation of a
strongly chirped pulse stability. We show that there are ``islands'' of
instability within a stability range of energies which result from stochastic
resonance between ``internal modes'' of soliton and quantum noise of the
``basin''. The transition to multiple-pulsing can be suppressed in a system
driven by a comparatively low-power seed. However, seed power growth increases
the mode-locking energy threshold and produces ``islands'' of instability as
the dissipative soliton energy rises.

Abstract: Metamaterials exhibiting hyperbolic dispersion enable unprecedented control
over light-matter interactions, from sub-diffraction imaging to enhanced
spontaneous emission. However, conventional plasmonic hyperbolic metamaterials
suffer from limited tunability and lack intrinsic emission capabilities,
constraining their utility for active photonic devices. Here, we demonstrate
the first room-temperature, electrically tunable, excitonic hyperbolic
metamaterial using aligned films of chirality-pure semiconducting carbon
nanotubes. Unlike plasmonic systems, these excitonic metamaterials of aligned
nanotubes combine strong optical anisotropy with dynamic electrostatic
tunability. Spectroscopic ellipsometry reveals that the hyperbolic dispersion
window can be electrically shifted by 53 meV, enabling real-time switching
between hyperbolic and elliptical regimes. Theory predicts that this tunability
translates to the propagation angle being modulated by 34{\deg}, driven by a
momentum enhancement 3.11 times that of free space, limited primarily by
material losses that can be mitigated through improved alignment. In addition,
simulations of the system exhibit a high Purcell factor of 1550 and a
modulation of 37 % without an optical cavity for a dipole placed 5 nm above the
aligned nanotubes. These findings establish excitonic carbon nanotubes as a
versatile platform for dynamically reconfigurable photonic metamaterials,
opening pathways for adaptive optical devices, electrically-controlled
spontaneous emission, and tunable hyper-lenses operating at room temperature.

photonics, a modular, recursive optical signal processing framework. In our
approach, fast electro-optic (EO) switch is used to either keep an optical
packet inside the loop, with the processing element embedded within, or to
release it from the loop and direct it towards the output waveguide. By
configuring the switch on a timescale shorter than a time the photon spends
traversing the loop, this architecture can achieve different optical
pathlengths in a compact footprint without sacrificing optical bandwidth. As an
example, we embed a phase-modulator (PM) inside the loop and demonstrate a
frequency shift of optical packets up to 420 GHz, using only a 3 GHz sinusoidal
microwave signal. By replacing the PM with chirped Bragg gratings (CBG), we
demonstrate recursive delay line featuring large group delays of 28 ps/nm over
a 30 nm optical bandwidth. Finally, by introducing asymmetric Mach-Zehnder
interferometer (AMZI) inside the loop, we demonstrate a reconfigurable
differentiation of the optical packet in time, up to an unprecedented
fifth-order. Our results establish a powerful and scalable platform for
multifunctional photonic processing, setting the stage for next-generation
integrated systems with ultrahigh reconfigurability and spectral-temporal
versatility.
