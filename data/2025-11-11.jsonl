Self injection locking (SIL) enables direct driving of soliton microcombs by integrated lasers, providing turnkey initiation and improved coherence, but it also pins the pump close to resonance, limiting both spectral span and tuning flexibility. Here we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that introducing a thermally tunable auxiliary microresonator extends the bandwidth of SIL soliton microcombs. By engineering hybridization of the pumped resonance, we achieve deterministic access to single soliton states and then push operation into a far detuned regime inaccessible to direct initiation. The resulting combs reach a near 200 nm span at a 25 GHz repetition rate, while preserving the SIL-enabled noise suppression throughout. Moreover, the added degree of freedom afforded by the coupled resonator architecture enables orthogonal control of the comb's repetition rate and center frequency. These advances expand the spectral reach and controllability of integrated soliton microcombs for information processing and precision metrology."}

We model ultrafast topological dynamics in an ITO/SiO$_2$/Ag multilayer supporting hybrid epsilon-near-zero (ENZ)-plasmon modes. Using a time-dependent Drude-Lorentz permittivity for ITO and rigorous coupled-wave analysis, it is found that carrier relaxation with a 10-ps time constant redshifts the ENZ resonance from 490 to 525~nm and shifts the reflection-phase singularities across the angle--wavelength plane. The motion of these singularities corresponds to the displacement of exceptional points and a discrete change in the cumulative winding number. The transient Floquet-like band structure exhibits avoided crossings and Dirac-type dispersions driven by ENZ modulation. The results directly link picosecond-scale permittivity dynamics to quantized topological transitions in non-Hermitian photonic systems."}

Wavefront shaping enables control over scattered light by modulating the incident wavefront, but its application in living tissue is hindered by tissue-induced temporal decorrelation. This study systematically investigated the real-valued intensity transmission matrix (RVITM), a high-speed wavefront shaping method, for light focusing across a broad range of speckle decorrelation times. The inherent trade-off between static light focusing enhancement and implementation speed is characterized, which provided practical guidelines for implementing RVITM in real-time wavefront shaping under varying dynamic conditions. Effective optical focusing using a RVITM with 33 ms runtime was achieved through porcine liver with decorrelation times as short as 13 ms, demonstrating feasibility for biologically relevant dynamics and supporting the development of adaptive, non-invasive optical control for biomedical applications."}

This theoretical framework integrates the geometric formalism of transformation optics with the thermodynamic principles found in quantum dissipative systems. This concept goes beyond traditional coordinate transformations by affecting the distribution of quantum energy and entropy in a coherent thermodynamic manner as well as reshaping electromagnetic fields. By employing the thermofield dynamics approach, we establish new rules that show how local energy and entropy densities are influenced by the Jacobian determinant of the mapping. This indicates that when the geometry is compressed, it increases the generation of quantum energy and entropy density, while expansion has the opposite effect, all while adhering to the laws of conservation and the second law of thermodynamics.\n  As a practical test, we reformulate the Casimir effect within this framework, yielding a continuous pressure law that connects the quantum and classical realms via a thermal weighting function. This relationship illustrates how both geometry and temperature jointly determine quantum pressure. Additionally, our numerical results for Drude-Lorentz metamaterials support our analytical predictions and align closely with the comprehensive Lifshitz-Matsubara formulation. In fact, QTTO offers a powerful and coherent platform for exploring energy, entropy, and quantum pressure in real-world dissipative media. Beyond our immediate findings, it opens up a systematic pathway for managing quantum thermal processes and controlling field fluctuations in metamaterials and curved optical environments."}

By adjusting the reflectivity of the two SIs and coupling strength between them, we tailor coherent mode interference to achieve high-performance optical analogues of Fano resonance. The device is theoretically analyzed and experimentally fabricated on a SOI platform. Theoretical analysis predicts periodic Fano-like resonances with a high extinction ratio and a steep slope rate, arising from strong coherent optical mode interference within a compact resonator comprising two SIs and a connected feedback waveguide. Experimental results align with the theoretical model, validating the expected resonance behavior and confirming the effectiveness of the design. These findings underscore the potential of compact coupled SIs for generating Fano-like resonances, enabling broader applications in integrated photonics."}

In integrated photonic devices, non-Hermitian physics can be used for direction-dependent light propagation, reconfigurable light paths, selective energy localization and optical isolators. In this work, we report previously unexplored direction-dependent mode splitting in ring microresonators, achieved by adding multiple scatterers around the cavity. Through experiments, simulations, and theoretical modeling, we unveil the underlying physics that changes the resonance shapes in resonant systems with backscattering. By engineering the spatial configuration of the scatterers, we can produce a predictable and repeatable direction-dependent mode splitting, enabling new ways to route light through optical resonators and photonic networks. In addition, the direction dependent mode-splitting can be used for precise near-field measurements, enhancing traditional sensing in integrated photonic chips."}

However, its realization in metasurfaces has been restricted to circularly polarized light, confining geometric phase metasurfaces to helicity-dependent operation and excluding them from the linear-polarization domain that dominates modern optics. In this work, we overcome this limitation by harnessing exceptional points of non-Hermitian physics. We introduce and experimentally realize quasi-exceptional-point metasurfaces that exploit engineered singularities to directly impart a geometric phase onto linearly polarized light. Proof-of-principle demonstrations with gratings and holograms confirm broadband and high-fidelity wavefront shaping across arbitrary linear polarizations, which has not been achieved with previous phase modulation approaches. By revealing an intrinsic connection between geometric phase and non-Hermitian photonics, our work resolves a long-standing theoretical impasse and establishes a new framework for high-dimensional light control, opening opportunities for scalable polarization optics, advanced imaging, holography, optical communications, and integrated photonics."}

Controlling RL emission direction in compact systems remains a challenge. Here we report directional random lasing achieved by infiltrating dye-doped nematic liquid crystals into a nanostructured silica metasurface. By adjusting pump energy, we induce a transition from uniform angular photoluminescence to a strongly directional emission peak at large angles in the amplified spontaneous emission and RL regimes. This directionality arises from enhanced spatial coherence in the strong scattering regime, enabling coupling of guided random-laser modes to high-angle diffraction through the metasurface grating. Our system demonstrates wide-angle RL beam steering at submicron scale without complex external components. These results provide a straightforward method to control RL emission directionality, advancing tunable coherent light sources and metasurface-based photonic applications."}

We introduce GiBS (Generative Input-side Basis-driven Structures), an inverse-design framework that represents the entire device using a compact set of coefficients from smooth parametric bases such as Fourier or Chebyshev functions. This formulation compresses the design space by more than an order of magnitude, enabling efficient optimization of complex, broadband, and aperiodic geometries. GiBS integrates this low-dimensional representation with an autoencoder-based manifold-learning workflow to map the relationship between geometry and optical response, facilitating rapid exploration, discovery of high-performance designs, and systematic analysis of fabrication sensitivity. The inherent smoothness of the basis functions ensures manufacturability while capturing the asymmetry required for nonlocal optical interactions. We experimentally validated the framework through the realization of a PEDOT:PSS broadband scattering metasurface, whose measured response closely matched full-wave simulations across 500-1100 nm. These results establish GiBS as a scalable, data-efficient, and fabrication-aware platform for the inverse design of multifunctional metasurfaces, bridging AI-guided representation learning with experimentally realizable photonic architectures."}
